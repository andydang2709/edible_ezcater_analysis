Another one of their stores offered to remake the order, area manager said no this store would remake when they opened, as of now still do not have the order! TERRIBLE SERVICE! \n",

Each “cone” was easy to grab and enjoy without everyone touching a platter. Loved the ease and convenience. The packaging was beautiful and very appreciated. Plus the delivery was extremely professional and assisted in getting everything set up and ready. Great job!\n",
      "I ordered the strawberry, banana, and apple dipped fruit cones that say they come with 10 each. This was for employee appreciation week at my work. We did not receive the full order; we were short a couple for each item.  I contacted EZcater right away and they tried to reach out to the caterer to see if we could get the rest delivered but they were unable to get ahold of them and I never got a response. I did not receive a refund or the missing items, so we were short a few for everyone in the office. \n",

      "The order was absolutely PERFECT!! It was on time, the delivery man was so nice and pleasant then the order itself was AMAZING (Everyone loved the fresh fruits and sweet treats!)!! I'll most definitely order from Edible Arrangements via ezCater again,  A MILLION THANK YOUs!!\n",
      "Everyone loved the fruit platters. A healthy alternative to donuts!!\n",
      "Fruit and desserts were very delicious and fresh.\n",
      "The dipped fruit was great. The cut fruit platter was awful. It was very apparent it was the dredges of the fruit from the shape cuts it was a barely full platter and was way overpriced. \n",

      "There fruit and dessert plates are amazing.  Great presentation and crowd favorites!\n",

      "on time. nice and fresh! would use again\n",
      "Order never prepared and did not even contact customer. Unprofessional. This was for game day as pre-game snack and it was embarrassing not having anything. EZ catering was very diligent in service trying to resolve issue but Edible Arrangements was nowhere to be contacted. \n",
      "The office was thrilled to get it! Very tasty.\n",
      "Fast delivery, very helpful vendors, my employees loved the food.\n",

      "Staff loved both the dipped and not dipped fruits. Fresh and elegant. Will use again! \n",
      "Honestly, it was amazing. People loved it for the meeting. Something different. HOWEVER, the second time we order from them, we didn't receive it. My meeting was at 9 am. I requested delivery at 8:30. The request went through, and Edible Arrangements approved it. The day came and they didn't show up. I called and they said they didn't deliver until 10 am. This means, they didn't set up their store hours correctly on EZ cater and approved an order they couldn't deliver. \n",
      "Love the beautiful presentations that EA makes. Always on time for delivery and always a BIG hit at work!\n",
      "Great option for vegan staff. The fruit was a healthy alternative to the sweets we usually provide! \n",

      "I would recommend this catering company \n",
      "\n",
      "I’m deducting stars because the order was not sent in its entirety. I ordered 3  total boards and only 2 came. The food was a big hit.  Just wished it all arrived..\n",
      "EZ cater made right by me and credited my account which was super nice\n",
      "The board was great definitely can serve more than 10 especially if you are having it as a dessert with a full meal we used it as a dessert with a fully catered dinner for a group of 30 and had leftovers. \n",
      "I like to order this for the office as a birthday treat. Both healthy and still sweet!\n",
      "It’s always nice to feel like you’re trying to be healthy by eating fruit, even if it has chocolate on it!\n",
      "Id give a zero if I could. \n",
      "Order never arrived. I tried desperately to call the store with no answer, EZCater tried their best as well with no luck, and no response.\n",

      "Had an amazing experience. The staffs are super amazing.\n",
      " Delightful treat.  I ordered a tray and the presentation was beautiful. \n",
      "Delightful treat.  I ordered a tray and the presentation was beautiful. \n",
      "The food was very good. But the service was subpar. My order got pushed to the following morning, and then was still over two hours late. With no communication to easy cater, the app, or myself. They marked the order as completed, a day early. I do not recommend if you need your order ready by a certain time on a certain date this is my second experience. I will not use again.\n",
      "Many thanks for accommodating my request to mix the individual fruit cones!  This was a refreshing afternoon treat.\n",
      "I did the bundle cones with strawberries, bananas, and apples, and it was a great afternoon snack\n",
      "Finger foods and delicious desserts that impress at corporate events.\n",
      "These chocolate covered strawberry bundles were perfect for an afternoon snack\n",
      "Very pretty arrangement and was a huge hit with the party!\n",
      "Top-notch experience: the tray was perfect, arrived on time and everything was fresh and delicious! I truly appreciate EA for this order as it was placed about as last minute as it could be. I recommend!!\n",
      "The cheesecakes with strawberries were a big hit!\n",
      "Great snack option-they even worked with me on delivery time due to me getting there late. \n",
      "Unreliable. Only delivered half of my order. Called to get the rest and they made another delivery but I still only received half of the fruit I ordered. \n",
      "The office was very happy with the selection of snacks and the delivery was on time!\n",
      "The food never arrived. I contacted EZCater and they told me they couldn't get into contact with Edible arrrangements & completely ruined my mothers day.\n",
      "\n",
      "I will never, ever, ever use Edible Arrangements or EZCater again. This is a disgrace.\n",
      "Reliability Rockstars! I placed my MOTHER'S DAY order on short notice for a head count of 80 with a 1 day time to prep and Edible delivered exceptionally well! I recommend 10 out of 10!\n",
      "This was a great mothers day gift. I did place the order the day of so unfortunately  it could not be delivered. I had to pick it up my self but it was worth it. \n",
      "Showed up on time. Everything was great.  Thank you!\n",
      "The chocolate covered fruit dessert was a hit and indulgent, a real treat.\n",
      "Perfect platter of donuts and fruit! They loved it!\n",
      "The strawberries weee devoured. Will definitely use again\n",
      "Such a hit! What a beautiful presentation by edible arrangements. People were so surprised because of the donuts included in the platter. All of the fruit and chocolate covered strawberries were delicious. I can’t wait to use this again for another office!\n",
      "I love their arrangements but they are NEVER on time for pick up orders. Waited 20 minutes despite noting a week in advance to have it done and ready for pick up at 2\n",
      "Always a good choice. Fresh and tasty. Give them a try.\n",
      "The trays look MUCH larger online than in person. I thought I order more than enough but when I arrived, I was concerned it may not be enough. Luckily it worked out. The arrangement was absolutely beautiful though. The nurses were very appreciate for nurses appreciation week.\n",
      "Everything was impeccable at a loss for words literally\n",
      "I picked up a snack for one of my office.  They did a great job on a cookie platter with chocolate covered strawberries and mini cheesecakes.  The office loved it and the perfect amount.\n",
      "If I could give zero stars I would.  This was the worst experience in 25 yrs of Pharma.  Edible Arrangements never showed up, never answered the phone when EZ Cater was trying to figure out where the order was, never answered calls from me and when I did get someone the next day, nobody ever called me back to explain why they were a no show.  The office was left without food and made me look bad - having to apologize incessantly and had to leave and get food.  DO NOT EVER USE THIS ESTABLISHMENT \n",
      "Food was great; however, it was delivered too early and caused me to miss many of the attendees.\n",
      "Do not expect your order to show up on time or for the location to even let you know they are running behind. Our order showed up almost 2hrs late.\n",
      "A great treat for staff that offers a bunch of options for a wide range of tastes!\n",
      "Delicious treats that our volunteers. They were delivered in a cooled van and wrapped so beautifully. \n",
      "Had to be dropped off a little early, but it worked out well. \n",
      "I had to call because I had to find out if they were in the building. No one ever answered their telephone line. It ended up being delivered but thought their customer service needs work. Not sure if I will use them again.\n",
      "The fruit was sweet and fresh and office loved their arrangements! \n",
      "Didn’t have order at all? Caused a lot of confusion and I had to scramble to go buy something else.\n",
      "Food is always good and a nice mix of fresh fruit and sugary treat\n",
      "\n",
      "Confusion with ordering and the arrangement didn’t look like the picture.\n",
      "The food was delivered on-time, wrapped well and coffee hot.  \n",
      "The arrangement was beautiful and tasted great! It kept well in the fridge overnight.\n",
      "It was tasty and different! Right on time.\n",
      "Truly divine! the tray was a treat and the fresh fruits were a HIT.  The delivery driver was right on time and very personable. All around great experience for my first order with EA\n",
      "Absolutely a huge hit with the team! Next time I would get cups to let people mix and match.\n",
      "Great fresh fruit in individual containers.  It was a hit for my event, will use again!\n",

      "Wonderful presentation. On time and everyone loved the snack. \n",
      "The fruit cups are fantastic for offices. I do a mixture of the strawberries, bananas, and apples. The office loves it.\n",
      "These were the perfect little cookies!! Not too big not too little and super delicious!! \n",
      "Great!  Always a good addition to your lunch!\n",
      "One of the best things I have catered, ever! \n",

      "Love the chocolate dipped apples, bananas, strawberries, but I wish the individual cups included an assortment of fruit because staff were taking 2-3 cups each and I ran out of snacks quickly.\n",
      "this was a bit basic for the amount of money I paid for it. Wouldn't get again\n",
      "Everyone loves Edible Arrangements.  It always makes everyone happy because it is so delicious. \n",

      "Unfortunately this order was never delivered. I received a text in the morning that it was on track to be delivered on time, but when that time passed I reached out to ezCater for an update. The CSR tried for almost an hour to track down the order, or reach someone at Edible Arrangements, but was not successful (disconnected calls or no answer). Eventually the order needed to be cancelled because the event had started. ezCater took care of processing a full refund. They were very responsive and helpful, I will definitely use them in the future - I've used them many, many times and this has never happened. But, I will no longer order from Edible Arrangements given my unfortunate experience with this order. \n",

They weren't open for a 8:45am delivery - so we had the fruit mid-morning (and not with our breakfast).  They did not notify me that they would deliver later and I had to reach out to EZ Cater to find out why they didn't show up until 10:30.  EZ Cater was awesome to help manage this for me.  It was very disappointing as they should not accept orders that are outside of their hours (or should ask you if you want a later time). \n",

      "We ordered chocolate covered strawberries for a valentine's day treat in the office. We knew they would be busy, so we put in the order early. Someone at Edible Arrangements reached out and let us know since they would be busy, they would have to most likely order an uber to deliver to us, but it may be later or earlier than the time. I appreciated the call and letting us know, they made the extra effort to accommodate us. Thank you!\n",
      "Unfortunately they had to substitute the day before my order was needed which I really did'nt have an option since it was Valentines day. The substitution did work for our group and the presentation of the food was nice.\n",

      "I wish I could give less than 1 star.   Our order was confirmed (several days in advance) to be delivered at 1:15 p.m. on 1/29.  On the day of our event,  Edible Arrangements reached out through ezcater at 11:30 a.m. to see if we would be okay with substituting most of our order to which I answered with \" I guess that would be okay since it's such late notice\".  The order was then reconfirmed at 12:15 p.m. for the 1:15 p.m. delivery.  At 1:25 p.m. the order had not arrived so ezcater reached out to Edible Arrangements who responded that they were not going to be able to fulfill our order and would have to cancel.  Edible Arrangements decided they would just not show up or call to let us know!  They obviously knew that they could not fulfill the order earlier in the day and could have let us know then so that we would have time to salvage our event.  This was so completely unprofessional and disappointing.  \n",

Also, upon further review, I checked the box for napkins, etc. They tried to blame EZcater and I knew that he was lying right to my face. Buyer beware. \n",

Highly recommend Edible for happy hours, and office treats for the holidays. \n",

      "This order never showed up.  I received a text saying everything was on time at noon and at 2pm no delivery had occurred.  By 2:30 I contacted support and was told the driver was on the way but they would issue a refund to me anyway since our delivery was time sensitive to the meeting celebration and travel constraints of my team.   The order never did show up so the driver either was not actually on the way or they decided because EZcater credited me for the delivery Edible Arrangements would no longer be bringing the items.  Either way, I will continue to use EZcater for their great customer service but will think twice before I order from Edible Arrangements again for a meeting or for a team gift, not very reliable.  \n",
      "The reason for the 3  stars is because the actual size of the platters doesnt look ANYTHING like the pictures and is SUPER expensive for what you actually get.   I was really excited about using them for this office that allows healthier snacks in the afternoon.  There are 60 people in this office. I ordered 3 platters and it was NO WAY enough.There was more cubed fruit than their chocolate covered specialties.The cubed fruit was little cubes of melon! Little!And there were a few grapes and not enough choc covered strawberries etc. I was extremely disappointed espcially becuase it was so pricey. Totally ridiculous for what you actually get.I couldnt believe how small the platters were.Maybe they are good for small gifty-type items but shouldnt be catering.\n",

The caterer tried calling 15 minutes after the schedule delivery time to ask Me about whether it was OK to substitute smaller plate sizes because they rather large plate, however, they did not leave a voicemail, so I had no idea it was them because I got a lot of random calls. I had to have ezcaterer Intervene and basically they said they could come in an hour to an hour and a half which was not convenient so we rescheduled for the next day. I didn't think this was handled professionally. This is not a comment on the fruit or chocolate because that was great, but I rely on professional service.  We all know they had reached out to EZ Caterer if they couldn't have missed me\n",

Because they said they got the order too late but I ordered it the day before and I got a confirmation. And then the food didn’t arrive. So I called EZ Cater. The agent called Edible Arrangements and then the owner of Edible Arrangements said they spoke to the girl in the office where it was to be delivered to see if she wanted to cancel. When I asked her, she told me nobody called her. So the owner told EZ Cater a lie. So I will never use Edible Arrangements ever again. \n",

Meeting was at 11, but figured while close, it could still work. However by 11:30 I could not reach them on the phone so I contacted ez cater and they also could not reach them. Had to cancel and refund the order. They called later to apologize they couldn't complete the order.  Really disappointed--they should update their information on this site if they have short windows of delivery or no capability for the size orders people need.\n",

The picture online seems to represent a serving platter when it’s actually about the size of a dinner plate. They were also not willing to deliver at the exact time I entered….when I called to confirm delivery they said they had a two hour window….that’s not anywhere in the ordering information. The fruit is good but for what you’re spending you can find better options. \n",

      "If I could give 1/2 star I would.  I ordered for a meeting 4 days in advance and requested delivery 2 hours earlier than the start of my meeting.  I reached out to ez cater customer service - who were awesome they were told several times by Edible Arrangements that the driver was nearby and would be at my office in a few minutes.  This was not the case, then I received two telephone calls from Gordon at EA stating that he couldn't reach the driver but that he was nearby and should be here any moment.  The final call with Gordon was about 1:35pm and I still have no platter.  I will never order from EA again, they clearly aren't able to deliver on the orders they accept, yet they had no issue with putting payment through and stating that the order was completed and delivered.  Gordon did offer to send another platter out that I would get in another 1.5 hours.  No thanks and buyer beware.  Thank God I also placed an order through another vendor on ezcater Small Cakes - who delivered early\n",

      "Delivery was great and on time. However, they charge extra for utensils and we ordered for 15 people and only got enough for 9. It's disappointing to pay extra for what other caterers provide for free and then not even get enough.\n",
      "I called to confirm delivery to the DR office, they said there was no note attached to let them know who it was from and the no thank you that I had wrote out.  If I wouldn’t have called they never would have know I sent it.  Could have been a giant waste of money to send if there is no thank you note attached. \n",

      "Terrible experience - ordered this to come at 8:45AM. At 9:10AM, I called EZcater as I had been waiting on the order. They put me on hold for about 10 mins as the customer rep from EZcater said he tried multiple times to call Edible Arrangements. He said they weren't answering so he was leaving voicemails and e-mails but couldn't get in touch. Finally, at 9:40AM I've given up on it as it's now an hour late. The receptionist at my building let me know it arrived. I ordered 2 platters of fruit - did not receive any serving utensils/tongs for either platter. I also ordered and paid for utensils (plates/napkins/forks) on my order, but naturally, did not receive those either. Overall, this has been a terrible experience by Edible Arrangements. \n",
      "Staff loved the fruit covered with chocolate and the selection \n",

      "The pineapples were sweet but soggy.  Trays were smaller in person than on line. Order arrived too early so most of the fruit was gone by the time of my scheduled arrival so I missed time with the staff.  I didn’t catch that there were napkins/plates/utensils provided by EA with the delivery.\n",

      "I’ve used this company regularly for the past year & always had stellar service in many cities across Texas. Today, (again for the 4th time now in 2 weeks), Edible Arrangements did not live up to minimum standards...food was 45 minutes late (despite being ordered a couple of days beforehand-not a last minute order). When the food was delivered, the delivery driver (who I’m told was the owner of the store) showed up, parked in a handicap parking spot, and took the tray in. She then proceeded to stay taking up a handicap parking spot for another 5 minutes (I watched as someone who needed that spot had to park elsewhere). I’m very disappointed in this caterer for many reasons. Although I really like treating my customers with their fruit platters because they’re delicious, I will unlikely use them again because of such poor customer service lately. As stated before, it has been now 4 locations with similar poor customer service & very late deliveries. \n",
      "Last minute request was handled perfectly! We will order again.\n",

      "Food was great, however the delivery was scheduled for 2:15 and the driver arrived at 1:06. Was not prepared for the delivery as I had no cool place to store it until we were ready to eat.\n",
      "Wonderful presentation. I'm not a big fan of white chocolate, but the white and chocolate covered bananas were delicious.\n",
      "The food is delicious. The presentation of the food is very nice. I’ve been ordering from Edible Arrangements for over a year now, and have had great service, however, the last two orders have been delivered very late-40-75 minutes after requested delivery time, despite having confirmation of order & delivery acceptance. The delivery driver was very nice to the staff on both occasions, however, on this particular delivery, the driver was confused as to who the delivery was for (an office) and he had the office call me to see if it was for a particular individual or for the whole staff. The service has just not been great for my last 2 orders. \n",
      "Driver was lost, called and gave me a heads up. I appreciated the communication. Beautiful arrangement. The office was very happy.\n",
      "The day turned out great. The fruit plates were delivered on time and the fruit was delicious!\n",

      "They arrived 30 minutes later than expected. Edible Arrangements had a 1 hour delivery window of 11-12 and I had requested 11:30 AM (for a  12 PM start) as a FYI.  But the cuteness and taste of the individual chocolate covered apples  made up for it. EZCater ordering page said 1 pack feeds 10 people, but there were only 8 individual packages as a FYI. Don't let that stop you from getting these,  just order within an hour window of when you need them and plan that it 1 pack feeds 8 not 10. That's why I still gave 5 stars! \n",

      "So delicious, great healthy snack. We loved it \n",
      "I was very disappointed.  I gave enough time for delivery.  Needed it for a meeting with the Executive Staff and 10 minutes before the meeting, I checked the tracking and it showed \"Delivered\" when I was waiting in the lobby.  I contacted EzCater and they tracked it down.  There was a misunderstanding about the delivery time.  I had to run to the nearest dessert store and was late setting up the afternoon snacks in the meeting.  They called back and asked if I still wanted the order delivered later in the day or the next day.  I just cancelled.  I'm sure it was a misunderstanding but I received a confirmation throughout the day from EzCater regarding the status so I don't understand how it was forgotten.\n",

      "Delivery was requested at 3:00 and fruit was delivered in the morning.\n",
      "There was an issue with communication between Edible Arrangements and EZ Cater. This is not something I will fault Edible Arrangements with because it seemed like a 2-way street, and the manager was kind enough to hop in the car and deliver my items personally as soon as he found out about the missed order. \n",

      "Delicious and healthy perk to our day. Thanks!\n",
      "Everything was great with the order except it was delivered before 11am. We had to move people's lunches in the fridge to make space. It wasn't a big deal, but I just don't know why you put in a time if they are going to deliver it hours early.\n",
      "Fantastic chocolate covered fruit, and fresh fruit platter cut into fun shapes. Made for a fun and interesting afternoon treat for the staff meeting, nothing was leftover!\n",

      "\n",
      "The fruit was overly ripe and many pieces had small holes through the center - it looks like they pulled fruit off of skewers from an old “bouquet” and chopped it up to make my fruit tray.  The strawberries that were dipped in chocolate were wilted and the tops were white.  The chocolate covered apple pieces also have skewer holes through them.  I have purchased nicer fruit trays from Walmart for half the price.  Very disappointed. \n",
