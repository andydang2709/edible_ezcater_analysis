Review
I love edible arrangements! They have something for everyone and all different price ranges. This time I did the apples which were fabulous and the individual chocolate strawberry cones. They were a hit for a party!
"Food was good, service was good.  Order was delivered on time. 

Thank you!"
Big office hit! Everyone was happy with this snack time option
It arrived on time and it was delicious. Would order again
"Fruit was fresh, arrangement was beautiful, and was ready when I picked it up."
Thank you for delivering on time and for being communicative :)
Everything was arranged wonderfully. I especially enjoyed the cheesecake
We love Edible arrangements.  Fruit is always so fresh and delicious.
This is literally the best for a snack! Everyone loved the individual containers!
We love Edible Arrangements.  It is always a wonderful choice.
"Edible Arrangements delivery is superb! Fresh, beautifully arranged fruit that's perfect for any occasion. Quick and reliable service. Highly recommend!"
"The cookie, cupcake and cheesecake platters are perfect for parties"
Food was great! Customer service was great! Thanks so much!! We appreciate it.
The presentation was very very nice and so good tasting. Thank you much
Fruit and dessert were very good and the office loved everything!
"Never disappoints! Edible Arrangements is such a nice change from the heavy cakes and donuts, especially in the summer months"
wonderful delivery and the quality of fruit we received was awesome.
"Went to pick up, they were closed due to  the lock on the door, did not find out till we got there to pick it up. Another one of their stores offered to remake the order, area manager said no this store would remake when they opened, as of now still do not have the order! TERRIBLE SERVICE!"
"Beautiful presentation, and delicious.  Everyone enjoyed the snacks.  Would use again"
Great value and beautiful presentation . I love ordering from here
"Great at keeping in contact with us, cookies were delicious"
The presentation and the fruit were excellent!! Would order again. Thank you.
food was stale and there were no utensils included with the order. i had no way to serve or plates to place the food on. no napkins either even though these items were specifically requested. this is the second time this has happened with this vendor. i complained to ezcater who did absolutely nothing. NEVER AGAIN.
Arrived on time and everything was delicious! Always a good time!
"Great snack for the office, everyone enjoyed it!"
"The order was 40 minutes late.   Plus, when the restaurant was called multiple times to get an ETA, nobody answered.  By the time it arrived, other food was ordered."
Arrived late but it was delicious. Good variety and fresh fruit
"Loved everything about the tray, it's a perfect mix of healthy and sweet! The order was just a tad early this time, but all in all that's okay!"
Amazing presentation and delivered with less than 24-hour notice. There was a great variety for everyone's preference. We will definitely be ordering again.
Fresh fruit was nicely packaged. Came on time. My team loved it!
The chocolate covered strawberries were a hit for this hard working crew. Lots of compliments.
Such a healthy and a unhealthy snack. Served right on time. Very professional.
TINY. For over $100 you’d expect something nice. So disappointing
Good option for a snack but they were out of many items & didn’t offer to remedy it.
The fruit is so fresh and juicy! You can't go wrong when you order from Edible Arrangements.
This was a last minute staff anniversary gift and it was awesome. Always great presentation.
Everyone enjoyed the special afternoon treat. Each cone contained both chocolate covered strawberries and chocolate covered pineapple. Each “cone” was easy to grab and enjoy without everyone touching a platter. Loved the ease and convenience. The packaging was beautiful and very appreciated. Plus the delivery was extremely professional and assisted in getting everything set up and ready. Great job!
"I ordered the strawberry, banana, and apple dipped fruit cones that say they come with 10 each. This was for employee appreciation week at my work. We did not receive the full order; we were short a couple for each item.  I contacted EZcater right away and they tried to reach out to the caterer to see if we could get the rest delivered but they were unable to get ahold of them and I never got a response. I did not receive a refund or the missing items, so we were short a few for everyone in the office."
I can't say enough about this order! Edible Arrangements did a fabulous job! Their trays are absolutely beautiful and delicious! I will definitely use them again!
"The order was absolutely PERFECT!! It was on time, the delivery man was so nice and pleasant then the order itself was AMAZING (Everyone loved the fresh fruits and sweet treats!)!! I'll most definitely order from Edible Arrangements via ezCater again,  A MILLION THANK YOUs!!"
Everyone loved the fruit platters. A healthy alternative to donuts!!
Fruit and desserts were very delicious and fresh.
The dipped fruit was great. The cut fruit platter was awful. It was very apparent it was the dredges of the fruit from the shape cuts it was a barely full platter and was way overpriced.
Customer loved their fruits baskets. On time and fresh
There fruit and dessert plates are amazing.  Great presentation and crowd favorites!
"It was perfect. It was on time, looked beautiful, and tasted wonderful."
Edible arrangements cone snack bundle is a great afternoon treat for the office. Who doesn't love  chocolate dipped fruit! YUM!!
"Fruit was fresh and delicious. Only ""complaint"" was the pineapple was more shredded than in pieces, but it still tasted good!"
Late arrival. It was good though.  No further comment
Good. Not on time like usual. Will be trying another vendor next time.
No comment. No comment. No comment. No comment.
You have to get these dessert trays for your group events!  SO many options so there is something for everyone!  Chocolate covered banana cones are my FAVORITE!
great delivery fresh fruit. Pineapple wasn't very ripe but the rest was amazing
Another wonderful experience with this location! They were excellent!
It was a hit for the office.  Very tasty and different than the norm.
on time. nice and fresh! would use again
Order never prepared and did not even contact customer. Unprofessional. This was for game day as pre-game snack and it was embarrassing not having anything. EZ catering was very diligent in service trying to resolve issue but Edible Arrangements was nowhere to be contacted.
The office was thrilled to get it! Very tasty.
"Fast delivery, very helpful vendors, my employees loved the food."
Office was very happy. Portions are not huge though.
chocolate covered strawberries individually packed were a big hit.
"First time ordering, and I was happily surprised with their options!"
Perfect for a light snack in the afternoon! Everyone loved it!
"Fast delivery, very helpful vendors, my employees loved the food."
Excellent experience with this caterer! The Corpus location was SO PROFESSIONAL!!  They were awesome!
"Delivered on time, packaged nicely, fruit (chocolate dipped apple slices) was fresh and chocolate coating was thorough. Gave them as gifts for admin day and they were very well received!"
I love getting the chocolate covered fruit cups as an afternoon pick me up at the office!
Staff loved both the dipped and not dipped fruits. Fresh and elegant. Will use again!
"Honestly, it was amazing. People loved it for the meeting. Something different. HOWEVER, the second time we order from them, we didn't receive it. My meeting was at 9 am. I requested delivery at 8:30. The request went through, and Edible Arrangements approved it. The day came and they didn't show up. I called and they said they didn't deliver until 10 am. This means, they didn't set up their store hours correctly on EZ cater and approved an order they couldn't deliver."
Love the beautiful presentations that EA makes. Always on time for delivery and always a BIG hit at work!
Great option for vegan staff. The fruit was a healthy alternative to the sweets we usually provide!
"Arrangement obviously not prepared fresh - berry stained pineapples, soft browned pineapple and mushy wilted strawberries under the chocolate dip, the melon was not ripe... typically they are beautiful and amazing, vey disappointed this time."
"The staff loved the variety, will order again."
"The variety was appreciated by all
And was very good!"
great arrangements/platters. delivered on time.  cupcakes were delicious.
"This place never disappoints! The team asks for these treats by name, and there is never a drop left."
First time ordering from E.A. And it was great. I would definitely order from them again - although it IS expensive !!
"Everything was perfect, so pretty and very tasty"
"Excellent presentation, snack was  perfect 
I would recommend this catering company"
"I’m deducting stars because the order was not sent in its entirety. I ordered 3  total boards and only 2 came. The food was a big hit.  Just wished it all arrived..
EZ cater made right by me and credited my account which was super nice"
The board was great definitely can serve more than 10 especially if you are having it as a dessert with a full meal we used it as a dessert with a fully catered dinner for a group of 30 and had leftovers.
I like to order this for the office as a birthday treat. Both healthy and still sweet!
"It’s always nice to feel like you’re trying to be healthy by eating fruit, even if it has chocolate on it!"
"Id give a zero if I could. 
Order never arrived. I tried desperately to call the store with no answer, EZCater tried their best as well with no luck, and no response.
I was not charged but what does that matter when you had a celebration with no desert."
Had an amazing experience. The staffs are super amazing.
Delightful treat.  I ordered a tray and the presentation was beautiful.
Delightful treat.  I ordered a tray and the presentation was beautiful.
"The food was very good. But the service was subpar. My order got pushed to the following morning, and then was still over two hours late. With no communication to easy cater, the app, or myself. They marked the order as completed, a day early. I do not recommend if you need your order ready by a certain time on a certain date this is my second experience. I will not use again."
Many thanks for accommodating my request to mix the individual fruit cones!  This was a refreshing afternoon treat.
"I did the bundle cones with strawberries, bananas, and apples, and it was a great afternoon snack"
Finger foods and delicious desserts that impress at corporate events.
These chocolate covered strawberry bundles were perfect for an afternoon snack
Very pretty arrangement and was a huge hit with the party!
"Top-notch experience: the tray was perfect, arrived on time and everything was fresh and delicious! I truly appreciate EA for this order as it was placed about as last minute as it could be. I recommend!!"
The cheesecakes with strawberries were a big hit!
Great snack option-they even worked with me on delivery time due to me getting there late.
Unreliable. Only delivered half of my order. Called to get the rest and they made another delivery but I still only received half of the fruit I ordered.
The office was very happy with the selection of snacks and the delivery was on time!
"The food never arrived. I contacted EZCater and they told me they couldn't get into contact with Edible arrrangements & completely ruined my mothers day.

I will never, ever, ever use Edible Arrangements or EZCater again. This is a disgrace."
Reliability Rockstars! I placed my MOTHER'S DAY order on short notice for a head count of 80 with a 1 day time to prep and Edible delivered exceptionally well! I recommend 10 out of 10!
This was a great mothers day gift. I did place the order the day of so unfortunately  it could not be delivered. I had to pick it up my self but it was worth it.
Showed up on time. Everything was great.  Thank you!
"The chocolate covered fruit dessert was a hit and indulgent, a real treat."
Perfect platter of donuts and fruit! They loved it!
The strawberries weee devoured. Will definitely use again
Such a hit! What a beautiful presentation by edible arrangements. People were so surprised because of the donuts included in the platter. All of the fruit and chocolate covered strawberries were delicious. I can’t wait to use this again for another office!
I love their arrangements but they are NEVER on time for pick up orders. Waited 20 minutes despite noting a week in advance to have it done and ready for pick up at 2
Always a good choice. Fresh and tasty. Give them a try.
"The trays look MUCH larger online than in person. I thought I order more than enough but when I arrived, I was concerned it may not be enough. Luckily it worked out. The arrangement was absolutely beautiful though. The nurses were very appreciate for nurses appreciation week."
Everything was impeccable at a loss for words literally
I picked up a snack for one of my office.  They did a great job on a cookie platter with chocolate covered strawberries and mini cheesecakes.  The office loved it and the perfect amount.
"If I could give zero stars I would.  This was the worst experience in 25 yrs of Pharma.  Edible Arrangements never showed up, never answered the phone when EZ Cater was trying to figure out where the order was, never answered calls from me and when I did get someone the next day, nobody ever called me back to explain why they were a no show.  The office was left without food and made me look bad - having to apologize incessantly and had to leave and get food.  DO NOT EVER USE THIS ESTABLISHMENT"
"Food was great; however, it was delivered too early and caused me to miss many of the attendees."
Do not expect your order to show up on time or for the location to even let you know they are running behind. Our order showed up almost 2hrs late.
A great treat for staff that offers a bunch of options for a wide range of tastes!
Delicious treats that our volunteers. They were delivered in a cooled van and wrapped so beautifully.
"Had to be dropped off a little early, but it worked out well."
I had to call because I had to find out if they were in the building. No one ever answered their telephone line. It ended up being delivered but thought their customer service needs work. Not sure if I will use them again.
The fruit was sweet and fresh and office loved their arrangements!
Didn’t have order at all? Caused a lot of confusion and I had to scramble to go buy something else.
Food is always good and a nice mix of fresh fruit and sugary treat
Confusion with ordering and the arrangement didn’t look like the picture.
"The food was delivered on-time, wrapped well and coffee hot."
The arrangement was beautiful and tasted great! It kept well in the fridge overnight.
It was tasty and different! Right on time.
Truly divine! the tray was a treat and the fresh fruits were a HIT.  The delivery driver was right on time and very personable. All around great experience for my first order with EA
Absolutely a huge hit with the team! Next time I would get cups to let people mix and match.
"Great fresh fruit in individual containers.  It was a hit for my event, will use again!"
We only received one of the three trays we ordered.
The fruit was VERY popular at our event.  Thank you.
Can never go wrong with Edible Arrangements - such great refreshing and sweet snacks for the team!
Always a staff favorite. The desserts are fresh and beautiful. Thank you so much!
The fruit platers were a wonderful afternoon treat for the entire office. They loved the chocolate dipped fruit as well as the flavorful fruit selection!
Everything was delivered on time and looked good.
"Fruits were fresh, presentation very nice and delivered on time."
It was good but super late. They wouldn’t answer the phone. I was so embarrassed to tell everyone that I wasn’t sure if it was coming or not. I may not order here again.
Wonderful presentation. On time and everyone loved the snack.
"The fruit cups are fantastic for offices. I do a mixture of the strawberries, bananas, and apples. The office loves it."
These were the perfect little cookies!! Not too big not too little and super delicious!!
Great!  Always a good addition to your lunch!
"One of the best things I have catered, ever!"
Trays were way smaller than I anticipated for the cost
Edible Arrangements was received and enjoyed.  Will order again.
Amazing as always!  I highly recommend edible arrangements
Order was ready on time. The 10 chocolate-covered strawberry cups were delicious and well-received. Thank you!
Always a great choice . Arrived on time. The fruit was fresh and presentation was amazing.
Everyone loved it. Great afternoon snack and pretty display
I cannot rave enough about this order!  The presentation was amazing!!!  I had no idea it would be such great portion size!  My team was very impressed!  A go-to for desserts!
"Love the chocolate dipped apples, bananas, strawberries, but I wish the individual cups included an assortment of fruit because staff were taking 2-3 cups each and I ran out of snacks quickly."
this was a bit basic for the amount of money I paid for it. Wouldn't get again
Everyone loves Edible Arrangements.  It always makes everyone happy because it is so delicious.
All of the fruit was delicious arranged very nicely on the plates. Everything was fresh.
"We ordered three platters, and they are beautiful and full of yummy treats! Will definitely order again!"
Best snack for the office. Chocolate covered strawberries. Big hit!
"The group was looking for snacks and edible arrangements delivered a delicious, yet healthy option for our team! Thank you!!"
Staff loved the food. It was very fresh and the perfect afternoon snack. Definitely recommend.
Was ready on time and beautifully packaged and tasted great
I order their deluxe trays for our client meetings - perfect!
This was our first time ordering from Edible Arrangements. The desserts arrived on time and were beautifully presented and super fresh. A big hit!
I love edible arrangements!! They are delicious and the team was happy for the delivery!!!
Sent in the afternoon as a staff “pick me up”.  A healthy option to coffee and snacks and very unexpected surprise.
Fabulous arrangements! Our groups loved the display and the savory edibles.
Office Staff loved the individual cones of chocolate dipped strawberries.
Delicious.. great job.. thanks for the consistency in delivering a good product
First time using them on EZ catering … everything looked amazing.
The nursing staff thought the snack was excellent!  The presentation was beautiful.
Such. Great way to treat your offices  to a fresh snack.
Food was on time and the treats were a hit. Fan Favorite
"I had to go pick up the order. When I got there I was told they never received the order, and didn't have what I requested in stock. I ended up waiting 20 mins for them to put something together for me to take back with me. The treats received were tasty, but again, not what I ordered."
Great snack option-the office loved the healthy choosings and not so healthy ones-ha!
Love getting their cheesecake/cupcake platter to celebrate office birthdays!
This was the perfect place to get some treats when all that was required was a snack...
Fruit was fresh and tasty. I felt like the value was worth it!
"For almost every event we have in the office, I get a fruit tray with some chocolate dipped fruit and it always disappears so quickly! Always fresh, juicy, and delicious!"
great platter of choc covered fruits. friendly service as well.
"Beautiful trays and fresh fruit. 
Thank you so much"
such a nice change! Office loved the snack and assortment.
"Amazing delivery, delicious and BEAUTIFUL food arrived with this order. It was perfect and exactly as expected for this event!"
Something special for our clients coming in from out of town. Arrived in perfect condition
"Fruit arrangements were delicious but delivery was 10 mins late, didn't include the plates/napkins/utensils as stated it would."
My staff loved this so much. Wish they would have brought plates but still so yummy
Great presentation. The platters were a huge hit!
Delivery was on time.  Everything was set-up and ready to enjoy upon arrival.  Was very fresh!  Will definitely use again.
The fruit was amazing!  It was all gone in minutes!
Everyone enjoyed all the fruits cheesecakes and cupcakes

DELIVERY WAS VERY EARLY BUT NOT A BURDEN.  ITEMS WERE PLEASING TO THE STAFF
We loved our Edible Arrangements order! The presentation was perfect and the delivery was right on time! Will definitely order again.
fresh fruit always delicious. i get the tower bouquet and it’s always a hit
This was delivered on time and the delivery person was great.  This made for a nice mid-afternoon snack.
The order was beautifully packaged and delicious. Thank you!
Great arrangements and fruit was very fresh tasty
Great! Had everything we needed with it and fruit was fresh.
Beautiful presentation and delicious. Fruit and cookies were delicious
chocolate covered fruit is always a fan favorite in our office!
"Beautiful presentation! We ordered the trays  and they are just stunning.  Think charcuterie board for fruit, sweets.  Our office really loved them.  And the sturdy wooden trays are reusable.  Everything was fresh, elegant, on time!"
Nice arrangement of food customers appreciated selection of food
"Quality and taste were excellent- but I ordered for 1:45PM and it showed up at 12:30PM. Had I not been available to find a fridge and keep it cool until I needed it, it would not have been good."
The order never arrived. EZ cater did reimburse for the lack of food. This was a first from the caterer . Very disappointing.
Cupcakes and Cheesecakes were a hit! The fruit tray was fresh and delicious. Definitely will order again
The food and service were great. Thank you!
Platter was perfect. Everything was fresh and cold upon arrival
Thanks for the last minute turn around staff loved the variety of cupcakes and cheese cakes YUMMMMMMMMMMMM
"Edible Arrangements is always fresh, delicious and fantastic. Everyone loves Edible Arrangements."
"Items were delivered to the address next door. Although the staff said it happens often with delivery services, the business name was on the order and shouldn't have been missed. EZCater was great about fixing this for me."
Wonderfully fresh and delicious. Edible Arrangements always do a fabulous job.
Good arrangement that fed everyone and delicious and delivered on time and was tasty
I ordered last minute - and they delivered and better than what I expected. Communication was great!
Everyone raved about the arrangement especially the cupcakes. It was presented beautifully . So delicious
"Unfortunately this order was never delivered. I received a text in the morning that it was on track to be delivered on time, but when that time passed I reached out to ezCater for an update. The CSR tried for almost an hour to track down the order, or reach someone at Edible Arrangements, but was not successful (disconnected calls or no answer). Eventually the order needed to be cancelled because the event had started. ezCater took care of processing a full refund. They were very responsive and helpful, I will definitely use them in the future - I've used them many, many times and this has never happened. But, I will no longer order from Edible Arrangements given my unfortunate experience with this order."
"Edible Arrangements is just wonderful.  Fresh, delicious, fantastic. Everyone is so happy with  Edible Arrangements."
"Office loved mix of healthy and ""treat"".  The fruit was fresh and sweet."
Absolutely beautiful and absolutely delicious. Edible arrangements is wonderful.
"The fruit was amazing.  Ontime as always, I  never have to worry about an ezcater order being late!"
"Absolutely delicious, fresh, wonderful.  Everyone loved it.  Everyone was so happy."
Perfect afternoon treat. Thank you! Staff enjoyed and last minute success!
Order was never delivered. Neither myself nor the EZ cater rep could get a hold of Edible Arrangements for an update/explanation.
Staff loved the edible arrangements! Great snack for everyone
Excellent choice…almost was delivered to wrong address…please always call the contact to ensure correct place.
"Fruit was fresh and delicious.  Delivery driver went above and beyond.  When recipient could not receive delivery, the driver brought it to an appropriate location for storage until it could be picked up."
everything was great and delivered on time! Will be ordering from this restaurant again!
"ALWAYS A HUGE HIT!  My people love the food from Edible Arrangements, I never go wrong when I order from them!"
"The chocolate strawberries were a huge hit. 
Nicely packaged as well."
"Restaurant didn’t have any napkins, utensils, or plates to offer. Office still enjoyed nonetheless."
I ordered this for out of town guests for a meeting.  They loved it.  The fruit looked fresh and tasted really sweet.  I will definitely order this again for meetings.
"The delivery and set up was perfect, thank you !"
"For the amount of money that I spent, I believe that we didn't get the quantity to money ratio.  Over $600 spent and 30 people devoured the small selection within 30 minutes."
The Arrangements were just beautiful and the selections were fresh and delicious. We will definitely order from here again.
Everyone loved it!!! So fresh and yummy!! It was a big hit for a large office of 75 employees!
I have had several issues with the company.  Today was no different. They were 20 minutes late and just dropped off order no apologizes and then the fruit had mold on it.  This is the last straw.  Never ordering from here again.
Really good food. The office loved the fruit
early and on time delivery. very professional. will order again
"no complaints, food was delivered on time. thank you"
I would not use this vendor. The portions are so small and I had to order more food on uber eats- plus they are very expensive for what they offer
Great treat for the office snack time! Everyone loves Edible Arrangements!
Customers were delighted when this arrived.  Will continue to use.
"Staff loved the variety of fresh fruit, cakes and chocolate.  It might've been me but the trays seemed smaller than they used to be."
Office favorite.  The platter trio is great for the different pieces that come on it.  Food is always fresh.
Lots of choices of fresh fruit for the staff and the cupcakes were popular
"So happy with this voice.. fresh, simple and on time"
"The berry bouquet was amazing, fresh and tasty. The delivery guy unprofessional, came with out any carts, called from lobby to help him out because my order was heavy to him,  and was late for 20 min! ridiculous!"
As always the arrangements were beautiful.  Nice little treat for our employees to celebrate employee appriciation!
Nice presentation and fun work snack for a group
Easy to order and well received by the office. No plates or utensils provided.
The only thing that I would like to see in the future is a little more of a big one in my we have some of the stuff in our walls and stuff like this wand
Great presentation and nice to have fruit and chocolate for sweet and healthy option.
Perfectly set up and amazing food thanks wow
Everyone is so excited when they see the Edible Arrangements.  The chocolate covered banana seems to be the surprising favorite.
wonderful as always. Will always be my go to for fruit
Wonderful fruit arrangement and cheeseboard for an office snack
"We did cupcakes & cheesecake trays, delicious and simple for a small birthday group as needed"
Food was beautiful. The delivery person was curt and borderline rude.
"The manager I forgot her name but was so kind, came in and introduced herself, the fruit was absolutely amazing and fresh and we will be ordering again soon."
Great afternoon snack with chocolate or not. Fresh fresh fruit
"Great service, restaurant helped me with the order to the car & everything was fresh"
"Fruit was fresh, delivery was exactly on time. Just not super personable delivery."
Ordered fruit platters for approximately 150 people. The fruit was so fresh and all of the guests were loving the chocolate covered fruit especially. Can't wait to order this again.
Staff was very surprised and pleased when they saw the dessert/fruit tray.
Excellent set up and food.  Everyone loved it
"Great! Had plenty and everything was pretty tasty, only complaint is that the melons weren't ripe so didn't taste as good 
Appreciated the layout and the price point. Made for a nice employee appreciation day treat for the office"
Ezcater could not get in contact with the catering team and the food ended up arriving and hour later after we decided to just cancel.
Price for amount of food was not well priced. Presentation was good.
Always a hit with the office.  Beautiful presentation and delicious!
"Oh my gosh, the chocolate covered strawberry cones were a treat!  We brought them in for Employee Appreciation Day and everyone thoroughly enjoyed them, fresh and tasty!"
Delivery driver was very accommodating!  Appreciate her! Food was fresh
"I ordered the cupcake and cookie platter for my staff. Everything was really good, the cupcakes were my favorite!"
Edible arrangements never disappoint. Always fun and fruitful to enjoy!
great food on time delivery and always consistent
They loved it and sent me a picture it was beautiful and tasty!
"Ordered individual fruit cups and they were fantastic.  Nice size and everyone loved them.  However, BEWARE, they will accept an order for early morning but not show up until much later. They weren't open for a 8:45am delivery - so we had the fruit mid-morning (and not with our breakfast).  They did not notify me that they would deliver later and I had to reach out to EZ Cater to find out why they didn't show up until 10:30.  EZ Cater was awesome to help manage this for me.  It was very disappointing as they should not accept orders that are outside of their hours (or should ask you if you want a later time)."
"This is always a refreshing treat , we enjoy the plain offerings too!"
HUGE HIT!!  Everyone LOVED it so I'll definitely be ordered again in the future!
Thank you!  Everyone loved everything!  So fresh!
These strawberries were delicious and delivered on time and in a beautiful display. Would order again.
great food on time delivery and always consistent
So good and so easy.  Everyone enjoyed this sweet treat for the afternoon.
Always perfect! A fan favorite at the office
Order did not arrive at all. Had to reach out to ez cater
"A little late, left at my door instead of handing it to me"
"Fruit tray was a hit, and I loved the chocolate covered strawberries."
This is the second time we have ordered from Edible Arrangements and both times have been good experiences. I recommend the fruit platters and fruit cups. The fruit is always fresh and ripe (sometimes supermarket platters have unripe fruit). The fruit on the platters is displayed very nicely (perfect for corporate meetings) and the fruit cups have been a huge hit for employee gatherings & trainings.
Great afternoon sweet snack with or without Chocolate. So nice
"the fruit was  huge hit!! my only feedback was that it was delivered an hour and a half early.  Thankfully we had room in the refridgerator.  otherwise, everything was great!"
The staff loved the fresh fruit long with the chocolate dipped fruit.
Everything was BEAUTIFUL and DELICIOUS!  Thank you so much!
The desserts and fruit and both great for large office treats!
Nicely plated for group staff. Really need to add utensils or tongs. Not a hard ask. Staff loved it. Everything was included in the order and Driver read directions arrived on time at the location.
Will continue to use this caterer. The food was delicious.
Easy delivery. The staff was so happy with the arragements!
The fruit was excellent. It was a real treat!
Beautiful and delicious treat display for our client meeting.
"Beautiful, fresh, and delicious.  This is a great choice."
On time and fresh! Will definitely order again!
The food was AMAZING! The office absolutely loved every single item. Thank you!
"We ordered chocolate covered strawberries for a valentine's day treat in the office. We knew they would be busy, so we put in the order early. Someone at Edible Arrangements reached out and let us know since they would be busy, they would have to most likely order an uber to deliver to us, but it may be later or earlier than the time. I appreciated the call and letting us know, they made the extra effort to accommodate us. Thank you!"
Unfortunately they had to substitute the day before my order was needed which I really did'nt have an option since it was Valentines day. The substitution did work for our group and the presentation of the food was nice.
A lot of things was missing from my order I brought bundles with flowers n teddy bears and balloons but only received fruit trays
"I recently had the pleasure of experiencing the breakfast catering services from [Catering Company], and I am beyond thrilled to share my ecstatic review. From start to finish, every aspect of the catering order was a culinary masterpiece that left a lasting impression on both my taste buds and those of my guests."
Everything was good but they forgot my balloons and teddy bears for all my packages
My first order with Edible and office loved it!
Very happy with the food. Packaging was sturdy
Ordered a small fruit platter and the choc covered strawberries for the office. The platter is quite small fyi
"The manager I forgot her name but was so kind, came in and introduced herself, the fruit was absolutely amazing and fresh and we will be ordering again soon."
Such a great dessert.  Fresh fruit and everyone really enjoyed the strawberries with chocolate.  Cookies were delicious too.
Excellent and delicious. On time and the staff enjoyed it. You need to offer utensils though
"Office really liked this. I picked up a couple trays for a snack and it was a hit. Fruit trays, chocolate covered fruit and desert trays and everyone liked it. Will definitely use them again in the future for snacks"
Always a hit with the team We will order again.
Wish the communication was better on timing but we made it work and the staff absolutely loved the treats
Super delicious!! The team loved the treats!! Thank so much again!
The arrangement was beautiful. Team really enjoyed everything.
What nice treats...everyone was very excited.  Ordered the cupcake tray and the chocolate dipped fruit tray.  A big hit!
This was a GREAT hit! I can't believe all the treat options Edible Arrangements has. We will DEFINITELY be using them again soon!
Thank you my co workers loved and appreciated the gift she recieved on time
Beautiful arrangements and delivery person was super nice!!
Cheesecakes were delicious! Topped with dipped fruit.  Will definitely order again!
"The manager I forgot her name but was so kind, came in and introduced herself, the fruit was absolutely amazing and fresh and we will be ordering again soon."
"Yummy and fresh
Still seems small for price, though"
Delicious and beautiful display of fruit and desserts. Everyone loved.
Everyone loved the Edible Arrangement. Fresh and good as always.
"My order was not delivered, as the store did not have anyone to deliver. They did not contact me or EZ-Cater to let us know so we could plan accordingly. Sad. But, i will utilize them again. Hopefully they can plan a bit better."
The fruit was delivered on time and the chocolate covered fruit was delicious.!
they are always on time and fresh food
The fruit trays are fresh and amazing!  Will order again
They always do a great job!  The quality is good and the service is too!

I love fresh fruit and cheeses!! Many thanks to Edible for a beautiful display!
Great!  Lots of food. And everyone enjoyed it
This was my first time to get Edible Arrangements and I will definitely order again. The office staff loved the chocolate covered fruit and the mini cheesecakes!
Everyone loves Edible Arrangements. Great design and fruit
The variety of choices were a hit for the office.
"I wish I could give less than 1 star.   Our order was confirmed (several days in advance) to be delivered at 1:15 p.m. on 1/29.  On the day of our event,  Edible Arrangements reached out through ezcater at 11:30 a.m. to see if we would be okay with substituting most of our order to which I answered with "" I guess that would be okay since it's such late notice"".  The order was then reconfirmed at 12:15 p.m. for the 1:15 p.m. delivery.  At 1:25 p.m. the order had not arrived so ezcater reached out to Edible Arrangements who responded that they were not going to be able to fulfill our order and would have to cancel.  Edible Arrangements decided they would just not show up or call to let us know!  They obviously knew that they could not fulfill the order earlier in the day and could have let us know then so that we would have time to salvage our event.  This was so completely unprofessional and disappointing."
My office absolutely loved this! Thanks for catering my event
Perfect snacks for our team. Fruit was fresh and cookies were great.
"Such a great afternoon snack. The office loved it. Chocolate covered bananas, and strawberries. Can you ever go wrong with that? :-)"
"Great choice for an afternoon snack, office loved it!"
"The presentation, the on time delivery, the variety of chocolate covered fruits, was an absolute hit in the office as a snack,

Definitely not the same boring thing! Delicious food and enjoyed by all.
"first time ordering, the driver was an hour late and the cheesecake goodies were to thawed, however it was all still quite tasty."
"The fruit is always fresh and delicious, other treats are great as well!"
Restaurant did not notify EZCater until AFTER the order was supposed to be delivered that they had an issue with their driver & wouldn’t be able to deliver for 2 more hours. Completely unacceptable!
Wonderful communication - highly appreciate it! We ordered for a team after party and it was a huge hit!
"We love to get the individual chocolate covered fruit cups, employees can grab and go!"
Got what I needed on time.  Would definitely order again.
The arrangements were beautiful and everyone loved it!

Great delivery even though the weather as not accomodating.
amazing as always really good yes yes yes
Great support of ezcaters however the cater was late with order 1 hour. Even tho I placed the order the day before
The rep from edible arrangements called myself and the office to confirm and went the extra step to inform me of 2 individuals that were out of the office and said they could deliver a day early. They also called to let me know when the order was delivered. The best customer service hands down !
Food was amazing and well prepared! Great idea for Valentine lunch dessert!
So delicious so professionally presented. A real crowd pleaser.
Always delicious and delivered on time! will order again!
Delivery was received on time everything was great.

This is an office favorite for a light snack
"Great selection of fruits and the arrangement was really amazing.
Will definitely recommend"
"Our order was cancelled due to the store not opening. maybe due to the weather but my issue was i didn't get an update or any notification until an Hour after i was supposed to be receiving my order. i had to reach out to find out, EZ caters assistance had a hard time getting ahold of someone from the store. i would of like to know sooner so i can find an alternative route for my order"
"Haven’t used in a while, but still high quality"
Beautiful presentation.  Delicious and fresh. Office was so happy.
"The tray looked as if something was place on top of it.  All the icing was sticking to the cellophane wrapper, it looked horrible. Taste was a 5, presentation was a 1."
"The fruit cups were a big hit, I will be ordering this again!"
A gorgeous edible arrangement! My customers were floored by the size and amount of choco goodies!
Food was great and well received by the office but delivery was almost an hour late.
"Everyone always loves getting edible arrangements! And honestly, this is one of the few things that I get delivered that I actually eat as well. The presentation and the food quality is always reliable always excellent."
Always a fav for me and my guests - its just nice to have a fresh fruit option for an afternoon snack.
"We ordered quite a lot of items, including chocolate dipped fruit, bouquets, and assorted trays. Everything was delicious and presentation was amazing."
"The office was so excited to have a fresh fruit snack from Edible Arrangements, but it was delivered to the wrong department and staff had to go get it."
Very reasonably priced and a delicious healthy snack. The clinic loved it!
Order was late. Miscommunication as they only deliver after 1:00.
"I ordered chocolate covered strawberries and a platter, which look great and super yummy. However, it was delivered an hour earlier than expected."
a little bit of a mix up but edible arrangements delivered on time and everyone enjoyed the afternoon treat!
Consistently a beautiful job.  Early but a beautiful presentation.

Delicious and unique set up. Easy experience overall and will use again.
Great choice for afternoon snack!  Fruit was fresh as always!! delicious!
"Never, ever, ever again. Late, rude, no plates or serveware, tiny portions for 20 people, and completely against me using EZCATER. DO NOT order from this place! Also, upon further review, I checked the box for napkins, etc. They tried to blame EZcater and I knew that he was lying right to my face. Buyer beware."
"Who doesn’t love chocolate covered fruit….? Always a hit, and a great option instead of the traditional sweets."
Delivered fresh and on time. Only reason I gave 4 stars was that picture on their menu showed a lot more fruit than delivered
"Great display and options, arrived on time and tasty treats"
"Great display and options, arrived on time and tasty treats.  Cute holiday options"
"Our order was good, but not as pretty/ripe as our platter shave been in the past.  Busy holiday season likely part of that."
"Great display and options, arrived on time and tasty treats.  Adorable choices for holidays"
"Great display and options, arrived on time and tasty treats and cute choices for holidays"
Wonderful service and excellent food will order again
Thank y’all for y’all service fruit was delicious and amazing
My employees loved the last minute  gift! Thank you
"Food quality was good, but as a “Holiday Tray” I did not expect to see blue and pink cupcakes. Pineapple stars and snowmen were cute. Everyone loved the chocolate covered strawberries. The order was late, but office wasn’t upset."
Thanks Edible Arrangements! The holiday treats were a huge win for everyone!!!
Big THANKS to Edible Arrangements! The holiday treats were a huge win for everyone!!!
Display of the food was fantastic. The team was delighted to see the snacks. It increased their experience.
Can't go wrong with Edible Arrangements! The holiday treats were a huge win for everyone!!!
Super disappointed with the Holly Jolly Dessert Bundle. $400 and all I got were 4 really small trays and no type of holiday decor on them. Very different from what was advertised on their website. It was the same exact title of product but very different when received.
the mini cups are perfect for larger groups
I Love everything about them. Highly recommend. Perfection ❤️🎈🌹
"The food was beautifully presented, freshest fruit, desserts were delicious and the chocolate caramel apples were such a nice treat I got for people to take home.  Appreciated the delivery was on time.  I did specify in my delivery notes to come to a different floor than our main address, however, it was fine, and I can always change the floor in the main address which I will do.  Highly recommend Edible for happy hours, and office treats for the holidays."
The cupcakes were amazing!  The presentation of how they were packed was beautiful!
Food was on time and great as usual.  Thanks!
"Fresh, Tasty, and always refreshing to our taste buds! I just wish we could tip them"
Beautiful fruit and dessert displays.  Timely delivery.  Fresh food. Highly recommended.
Definitely will order more in the future - great snack!
"Very presentable, healthy and fresh snack, everyone loved them!"
Always a good choice for work events or special occasion’s
Great platter for a client event.  Everyone loved it
Order arrived promptly and well put together! Will definitely order again!
"Order was good, exactly as ordered and arrived on time"
Delicious. I Love everything about them. Highly recommend. Perfection
The office had a holiday party and they loved the assortment!
The fruit looked beautiful.  Yet the delivery was all off. Asked for a 430 delivery time and they were at the door at 10am.
On time and the food was good. Will do again.
on-time. The individual portion packs are a great option for big groups.
Offices love the fresh fruit and presentation. Thank you
Delivery was on time. Everyone enjoyed the large platters with the mix of fruits/cupcakes/cheesecakes etc.
"Arrangement was beautiful to look at and is a fine option for those who want a healthier dessert option. Fruit is gluten-free, but wasn't marked as so on the menu on ezCater - would be helpful if that was labeled so I can find it when filtering!"
Thankful that Edible Arrangements was able to accommodate an order with 24 hours notice; this is a great option for those with dietary restrictions and want a healthier option!
They accepted the order but did not fulfill it leaving me with no other options. Won’t use again.
The platers were very nicely done and well received
Delivered on time and the presentation was very pretty.
"I've ordered from Edible Arrangements twice now, and their food is a hit. These were for events where I had a range of sweets and snacks (cupcakes, charcuterie, cookies) and wanted to also have some healthy options (fruit cups) and chocolate dipped strawberries. The fruit is fresh and the packaging is nice. All of it got snapped up. They're easy to order from and have been reliable with delivery. They also have other sweets and I've ordered those, too. Highly recommend."
Best ever greatest location friendliest and clean fresh and sanitary awesome job team edible arrangements San Gabriel
The delivery was great and nicely presented - would order again.
My customers liked the variety of fresh fruit and dipped fruit.
Big hit in the office! Everyone was pleased with the order.
Had visitors to our business site; they really enjoyed having something different for their snack break!
This has become my go to caterer for snack options for my clients. They love the assortments and the fruit is always fresh.
"Order arrived timely, was enjoyed by all employees to partook in the tree decorating event."
The food was fresh and delicious! This is an office favorite
Always a great choice! Can’t go wrong with them
These trays are absolutely delicious and a real crowd pleaser.
"This was absolutely amazing! I think a lot of people have heard about edible arrangements, but haven’t actually received it as a gift. So many people said they are actually going to order it for their holiday parties. The fruit was fresh, and the chocolate was amazing and the cheesecakes were great. Cannot say enough good stuff about it. It was on time and beautiful."
"Wonderful arrangement, delicious and as expected :-) thank you! Will order again!"
BEAUTIFUL! They were able to complete my order in quickly with a short turn around. The baskets looked stunning. Everyone loved the fruit and the cheesecakes.
Excellent quality and customer very happy and on time

"Delivered on time and delicious, however portions are super small!"
office absolutely loved these chocolate apples and fruit tray.  Looks spectacular
"Great service, most definitely would recommend ez cater"
Really nice fruit platter and treats on the side!
"The delivery guy called my cell phone and said ""you put the wrong suite #,"" which I thought was unprofessional for blaming me for why he was not on time. Afterwards, I looked at the delivery address I have in the system and the address was correct. Didn't appreciate the tone of voice and being accused. I wasn't even upset that the delivery guy was a little late."
"On time, and the food was delicious. Whole staff loved the tray"
The bananas were a hit with the whole staff
"Delicious! Office absolutely loved the idea, and it was the perfect amount of food!"
"Great display and options, arrived on time and tasty treats.  Such a cute spread"

Beautiful arrangement and so yummy! I love giving this !

So great. Beautiful arrangement  and so delicious ! Fan favorite
"Arrived on time with delicious, healthy options.  Great for a patient event!"
The fruits tasted great and looked awesome! On time delivery!
Can’t go wrong with Edible arrangements!!! This was a hit!!
"Delicious! Office absolutely loved the idea, and it was the perfect amount of food!"
Dropped off as though it were a gift.  I wanted plates/napkins/forks and didn’t include it.  Just shrink wrapped all the fruit trays together.  It was good/on time though.  Not conducive for a catering style snack is all.
Great afternoon snack for office. Many healthy options
This location of Edible arrangements was nice and pleasant. There was a discrepancy with the address that was provided and the delivery driver called to make sure the address was correct. This location also guaranteed delivery when another location was unable to deliver.
Staff truly loved the combination of chocolate covered and fresh fruits - a great healthy afternoon snack!
THE ARRANGEMENTS WERE BEAUTIFUL AND DELICIOUS.  THE OWNER MADE THE DELIVERY AND WAS EXCEPTIONAL AND PERSONABLE
The office was very appreciative.  Fruit was fresh
Great presentation and it was fresh fruit. Will use again
The office LOVED their snacks. It was delivered on time and the food was fantastic!
"I ordered the cupcake and cheesecake platter. The desserts were very small for the cost of 69.95.  At first sight, I thought they forgot a platter.  I would not recommend that selection."
How can you go wrong with FRESH fruit and cookies? You can't if you choose edible arrangements
Food was great with lots of options to choose from
Great experience! Thank you to the Edible Arrangement team. Will definitely be ordering again soon.
Great quick snack option! They have really good fruit trays!
Beautiful arrangement of yummy chocolate and fruit! Whole office enjoyed
The office LOVED the fruit arrangement!  It was almost gone by the time that I arrived to meet with everyone!
Fresh and well liked by all. Presents well and staff enjoyed it
Fruit was good but portions are smaller than expected for the number of people they said they would serve.
Ordered cupcakes and cookie tray and staff raved about it all!  Very nice presentation.
Everything we received was perfect! The bananas are my favorite!
The food here is always great thank you so much!h
The order was late despite calling ahead the day before to ensure they could accommodate.
desserts were beautifully displayed.  EVERYONE RAVED about all of them.  The cupcakes cookies cheesecakes were scrumptious.  The plain fruit was a big hit with several employees.   there was something yummy for everyone.  Definitely will order again for our next project milestone celebration and Edible Arrangements is Highly recommended !!!
"This order never showed up.  I received a text saying everything was on time at noon and at 2pm no delivery had occurred.  By 2:30 I contacted support and was told the driver was on the way but they would issue a refund to me anyway since our delivery was time sensitive to the meeting celebration and travel constraints of my team.   The order never did show up so the driver either was not actually on the way or they decided because EZcater credited me for the delivery Edible Arrangements would no longer be bringing the items.  Either way, I will continue to use EZcater for their great customer service but will think twice before I order from Edible Arrangements again for a meeting or for a team gift, not very reliable."
The reason for the 3  stars is because the actual size of the platters doesnt look ANYTHING like the pictures and is SUPER expensive for what you actually get.   I was really excited about using them for this office that allows healthier snacks in the afternoon.  There are 60 people in this office. I ordered 3 platters and it was NO WAY enough.There was more cubed fruit than their chocolate covered specialties.The cubed fruit was little cubes of melon! Little!And there were a few grapes and not enough choc covered strawberries etc. I was extremely disappointed espcially becuase it was so pricey. Totally ridiculous for what you actually get.I couldnt believe how small the platters were.Maybe they are good for small gifty-type items but shouldnt be catering.
Edible Arrangements delivery was on time and great!
"Awesome! Everybody loved the food, will absolutely order again!"
"Everyone loved the fresh fruit and the chocolate dip fruit.  I ordered it, and I did not even get a chance to have any before it was all gone!"
This is an office favorite for a quick healthy snack
"I ordered a Halloween platers. It was nice, the office enjoyed them."
"amazing as usual and delivered on time, delicious"
Pathetic amount of food for the price. So overpriced I will not ever do this again!
They were great.  We ordered for a bridal shower and they loved it.
Small portions for the amount of money you spend
"Disappointed this time around the order was over fifteen minutes late, dropped off in haste and nothing was laid out. Food was good as usual and everyone likes it a lot. First time I ordered everything was great. This time, exact same order, exact same place and not as expected on the delivery. Not sure if I would risk ordering again when timing is important."
"Fruits are always good, just has to get refrigerated if out for longer than a hour"
These dessert boards were amazing and each treat was delicious. The account was very satisfied.
Desert tray was pretty good. Nice to have a mix of healthy options in with the other goodies.
Edible Arrangements provides a healthy snack!!!  Everyone in the clinic appreciates a healthy snack PLUS Edible Arrangements is amazing!!!
A perfect snack for a large office. The staff loved it.

"Food was excellent, great variety and arrived on time.  Was a crowd pleaser and delicious goodies!"

On time and everyone loved it thanks again
"Smaller than I expected and some pieces of pineapple were the middle part so not edible, but otherwise good."

My clients loved the treats.  Portion size for price paid is not great.
The best edible arrangement in Chicago.I will definitely be ordering again
I ordered a three trays that supposed to be for 30 people. I would say it was more like for 20 people. Also as an FYI. One of the three trees was just fruit. It was not chocolate dipped fruit. Overall what was served was well liked.
Perfect afternoon treat. Thank you. Will order again.
So good!!! My team really enjoyed this option!! Will order again!
Our Team sent a cookie & fruit plate to another team member to thank him for something he did for the whole team.  He and his wife really appreciated it.
Platter was a little smaller than expected; this is a case where photos would be useful so we can understand what we'll receive. Desserts were delicious and the staff definitely enjoyed them.
This was absolutely perfect for what we needed! The little cheesecakes were a huge hit.
This order was delivered perfectly. The presentation was perfect and everything arrived cold and in tact.

"Everything was fantastic from the delivery to the food, and the food is FANTASTIC! Beautiful arrangements."
Delivered my order on the wrong day/ wrong week and then insisted I was wrong when the delivery date is clearly indicated... nearly ruined an executive event! Not dependable/ reliable and certainly not responsible enough to own their errors. I wont be ordering from here again!
I ordered this fruit/dessert tray for my CEO visit and he and the other executive guests loved it.
This was a great afternoon snack for a large office.
First time to order a cupcake/cheescake tray - so worth the money

GREAT alternative to chips - cookies - cakes!  The chocolate dipped fruit was amazing and fresh!  Team loved this pick me up snack!
This is always such a nice treat. My office loved it.
Missing half of the order. Items substituted without any communication. Just say no! Read their Yelp reviews. Seems to be the norm.
This is the first time I ordered and it was a hit! Definitely a great snack option
"When the order didn't show up on time I called. The lady tried to explain to me that they couldn't see the time on their end and how their delivery process works, etc. I understand maybe it's not her fault directly, but at the end of the day if the system does not give you the time that I'm requesting then maybe don't deliver through EZCater because it completely ruins the customer experience. I don't recommend ordering from them on here!"
Everyone loved and enjoyed the beautiful edible arrangement.
Everything was so Perfect and on time thank you.
"Fast delivery , professional service will recommend, and they loved it"
How can you go wrong here!  The chocolate covered apple cups were amazing and the fruit platter was delicious and beautiful.  Everyone said it was a splurge and was super happy!

"Everyone loves this snack! Fresh fruit is a hit in this summer heat, and the cups with the chocolate dipped berries is always fun"
Disappointed in the delivery time as they had the wrong delivery time in their system. Also had a hard time contacting when we were wanting a simple update on ETA and what really happened. They were a hour late for a birthday celebrations. Our office did love the spread and had a great celebration.
Delivered to the wrong location despite clear instructions. Fruit trays were very small for the price.
Mini cheesecakes with chocolate dipped fruit looked and tasted delicious!
The fruit is always so beautiful and delicious. Thank you!

"This was the first time I ordered from Edible Arrangements and I was disappointed in the amount of fruit we received. I ordered 3 trays thinking there would be plenty, but the trays were way smaller than I had anticipated. The fruit was great, you just don’t get much for what you pay for in my opinion."
The fruit platters are an office favorite for a surprise snack on a hot day!

This is the best treat ever!  The team really enjoys this everytime.

I placed this order weeks in advance and received confirmation that they would deliver. On the day of my meeting I waited and waited for delivery and then contacted ezCater.

I was able to get another establishment to deliver but I will never order from EA again!

Very fast and convenient service! Beautifully packaged bundle!
There was a mix up on this order but Ez Cater did a great job with following up and rescheduling.

The strawberry Choclate arrangements were great. The driver was nice and it was on time
"Ordered Party Platters two weeks in advance for an event to be delivered an hour before the event to ensure it would be available on time. Store confirmed order 10 minutes before it was due to be delivered and never showed.  Corporate Edible Arrangements, EZ Cater and myself all tried for an hour to contact the store and they did not respond.  Did not receive order."
Major hit with the office.   Great snack of chocolate covered fruit.
"A little bit sinful, a little but sweet! Options for as good or as bad as they want to be!"

Delicious and beautiful arrangement. The office loved it and I would order from them again.
Forgot entire platter and then said they could not bring it to the office. Wanted me to pick up (over 20 minutes away) but said they had to make it first. Fruit tray did not look fresh. Left me without enough food for my customers.
Pat was very communicative and everyone loved the treats. Thanks for everything!!!!

Their fruit is beautiful and everyone always enjoys it!

Great as always! I’ve ordered from them several times and they have consistently been on time. They even reached out to confirm they were delivering to the right place when they were unsure.
Staff loves the assortment! Everyone was happy. Especially with the turtle cheesecake!
Have had better experiences in the past. Today's order was lost and it was made wrong and over 4 hours late.
This order was delivered an HOUR LATE!  I called and they said it would be there in ten or fifteen minutes and that was not correct.  I had already seen all of the physicians by the time the order arrived.  It was very disappointing!
"It tasted as good as it looked!
Office loved it"
Not impressed with this location. The fruit was not fresh
Fruit was delivered on time and everyone loved it!

It was so yummy and the client loved it. Great customer service
Such a unique dessert tray. Client loved it.
"THANK YOU WILL BE ORDERING AGAIN, THIS WAS A LAST MINUTE ORDER."
The time couldn’t be done because they weren’t open so miscommunication ended up edible arrangements taking care of it not ezCater.
"great food, was great, great food, was great, great food, was great, great food, was great,"
Delivery arrived on time and was well packaged. You can’t go wrong with ordering from edible arrangements.
"I placed this order for three platters, and they weren't initially delivered. The caterer tried calling 15 minutes after the schedule delivery time to ask Me about whether it was OK to substitute smaller plate sizes because they rather large plate, however, they did not leave a voicemail, so I had no idea it was them because I got a lot of random calls. I had to have ezcaterer Intervene and basically they said they could come in an hour to an hour and a half which was not convenient so we rescheduled for the next day. I didn't think this was handled professionally. This is not a comment on the fruit or chocolate because that was great, but I rely on professional service.  We all know they had reached out to EZ Caterer if they couldn't have missed me"
On time and very good customer service.  Th fruit was fresh as well.
"The office loved the fruit, great mid morning healthy snack!"
I ordered a fruit platter and a cookie and cupcake platter for 10AM delivery. It arrived 2 hours late and we received just the cookie platter. Basics of an order should be able to fullfill it
"Product was great, delivery was 2 hours late"
Office loved the fruit and presentation!  Great mid afternoon snack
Office loved the fruit!  Great presentation and yummy
"Hello
This was not anywhere near my expections, it said it would feed/support 30 people, we recieved 3 small plate of fruit for a cost of  $155 plus and it was gone in a matter of minutes"
"On time delivery, food was great -- the team was happy with the choice and we will order again!"
"Lots of issues stemming from a typo on the address (my fault). Delivery driver never called me I had to contact EZ, Cate
Fruit trays were delivered nearly 3 hours after they were supposed to be"
Berries were beautiful! Not sure why there was so much confusion on delivery but I chalked it up to the business being new to EZ cater.
"The fruit was absolutely delicious however, the order arrived 2 hours late."
"Food loved by all, nice mid morning snack"
Placed this order about 6 hours before I needed it and everything was great. Appreciate the help last minute
I live this place and the staff did too!!! The cupcakes and cookies were a great add on to all the fruit options!
"Office loved the fruit, a nice mid morning healthy snack"
Edible Arrangements is always my go to for any occasion! The office was so excited I sent this
School staff loved the edible arrangements.  He was fresh and delicious
"The food was beautiful, tasted great and was delivered perfectly"
Great food and great customer service! Everyone enjoyed it
"The arrangement itself was beautiful. The driver was questionable/ he called to say he was late because they had equipment issues which prevented them from making the order on time. Then he called to tell me his Lyft app messed up his maps so he couldn’t find me. He was 20 minutes late. I’m not which, if any excuse, was true. Hope they can find a more reliable driver! In would like to order from them again!"
Was the perfect healthy snack for my clinic! Edible Arrangements is always my go to for any occasion!
"I love that they’re delivering on EZ CATER now!! Always a great treat, everyone love’s Edible Arrangements!!"
Always a good choice for a nice treat
I do the big party tray that is always an office favorite
It was late but there was an accident. Driver felt bad
"Delivery was on time and the fruit was amazing, will use again."
"Thank you for your reliability. The presentation was classy, as well."
The food was exquisite food was amazingly delicious.
"even though you select a time for this caterer, apparently they don’t honor the time, so if you need at a specific time, pick it up, they do not guarantee delivery time. Very unprofessional and over an hour late. 
Edit: tried for pickup on next order and they just never made the order and had no apology or offer of compensation. Worst company ever!"
"Who doesn't like fruit? now that the fruit, cookies and other treats are presented and served on disposable trays this great option is within company compliance. Delicious afternoon treat!"
"They helped me find just what I needed to order for National Banana Day!
So Fresh so Delicious!"

Fruit was fresh and delivered on time with a smile!  This is always a crowd pleaser!
"I was told by the EZ Cater agent the food was going to be delivered on time despite Edible Arrangements saying they couldn’t. Because they said they got the order too late but I ordered it the day before and I got a confirmation. And then the food didn’t arrive. So I called EZ Cater. The agent called Edible Arrangements and then the owner of Edible Arrangements said they spoke to the girl in the office where it was to be delivered to see if she wanted to cancel. When I asked her, she told me nobody called her. So the owner told EZ Cater a lie. So I will never use Edible Arrangements ever again."
"Order the tray for an office event, and it was a great hit!"
Our office loved this arrangements and we look forward to purchase once again.
Absolutely amazing and fruit is so unbelievably fresh. The chocolate is very smooth on the fruit. Its a big hit!
The driver was rude to the office staff over some confusion and the trays I ordered were substituted without alerting me.
HUGE HIT for something different for a snack appointment. EVERYONE came back and they loved it. The chocolate covered strawberries in a cup were the top favorite.
Fresh fruit and chocolate. What more can you want?
"Charged delivery and I had to pick-up. Fruit was soggy, clearly had been out of the fridge for a while. Not impressed"
"Was fresh and delicious. However, I was expecting more items in the cookie and cake platter than what arrived."

"Great snack for offices but the servings are incredibly small, so need to order extra ie. Tray to serve 30 people realistically serves more like 20 in my opinion, especially if people eat more than one piece of chocolate covered fruit."
Very good as always. Thank you edible arrangement!
Nice treat for the office.  Will order more for an afternoon pick me up!
The staff loved their dessert.  Will reorder again
Thx for the message in my delivery. We will order again
Fantastic desserts - the cupcakes were amazing!!! will definitely reorder
Thanks for the message on the delivery.  We will order again. Thanks much
"We have specific instruction placed in our orders that all caterers must come up through the freight elevator and not leave food at the security desk.  Food was dropped off in the wrong location.  Food was good, but delivery was not."
Delicious and delivered right on time. Thank you!
If I could give 10 stars I would!! Last minute delivery address change didn't even phase these guys! Professional and helpful .... will support this business 100% based on customer service alone.  THANK YOU!!!!!

"This was my first time, ordering edible arrangements and will not be my last. It was a fun afternoon treat for an office, and the fruit was fresh and delicious."
This was a huge hit for an afternoon snack. Everyone loved the chocolate covered strawberries and apples!
Wonderful way to show someone they are appreciated with fresh fruit and chocolate!
"Unfortunately, they list delivery starting at 9am, but I received a call at 5:30 the day before saying they cannot deliver before 11am and that they ""don't get notices from ez cater about orders, so didn't know it was there."" (also, I ordered a week ahead of time). Meeting was at 11, but figured while close, it could still work. However by 11:30 I could not reach them on the phone so I contacted ez cater and they also could not reach them. Had to cancel and refund the order. They called later to apologize they couldn't complete the order.  Really disappointed--they should update their information on this site if they have short windows of delivery or no capability for the size orders people need."
"BIG HIT WITH THE OFFICE, LOVED THE MIX OF FRUIT AND COOKIES."
Wonderful option for busy offices with individual portions.
"The edible arrangement was perfect and delicious. 
It was also ready as requested"
"Easy, simple, refreshing for afternoon snacks for the office. Nice displays too."
Always reliable and always a hit with the offices with a large selection of items to choose from.
The food never showed up it was supposed to be there at 2:45 I got a message at 6:15 PM asking if I was still there. Please credit my account immediately! I will never use them again.
"Fast, good packaging and great assortment of fruits."

First time ordering for the office. Everyone really enjoyed the change in desserts as well as a nice afternoon treat. Thank you for delivering on such short notice!!
Fruit tasted fresh and the office enjoyed the mid-afternoon treat.
"My order was scheduled for 10am, at 10:15 I had a fantastic EZ Cater representative who called the store and found out their delivery drivers don't arrive until 11:30, meaning my order would be here sometime after noon, TWO HOURS LATE. The the store knows they don't have drivers who can deliver before noon, they shouldn't be accepting early morning orders."
Thank you. The customers loved it. I appreciate the call when they couldn’t find the contact to deliver.
The delivery came sooner than expected. And great people over there

"The orders were fine, but I had the same issue I had the time before where I put in my order for the correct date and their computers showed it for the following day. They actually called me to confirm this time but I don't know whats going on with their communication from EzCater to the company."
Tray was a great hit! Sadly arrived more than 1 hour late and the driver was no honest about his ETA.
This was an awesome experience all around. The deliver provided clear communication. The delivered items were as represented in the picture. And it was a sweet Valentine’s Day treat for the office.

"Order was 30 minutes late, but the fruit was fresh and delicious."
this order was delicious and prompt - thank you!
Everyone always loves edible arrangements and it was fresh this time around as always
Nothing better than dipped strawberries and bite size cookies
"I was very disappointed with this order, I ordered the three platters that serve 30 and there wasn’t enough to serve anywhere close to that number. The picture online seems to represent a serving platter when it’s actually about the size of a dinner plate. They were also not willing to deliver at the exact time I entered….when I called to confirm delivery they said they had a two hour window….that’s not anywhere in the ordering information. The fruit is good but for what you’re spending you can find better options."
Good good good good good delicious I like it really good

Perfect and delicious idea to send for offices as a recognition
I am pretty sure I wrote a card letting them know from who and wishing them a Merry Christmas.  They said they did not get it. So they had no idea who sent it.  Do you not attach the card with the arrangement?
Always enjoyable chocolate covered strawberries and chocolate covered apples

"Can't go wrong with chocolate covered fruit.  Only issue, they seemed to miss our order. Had to reach out when it hadn't arrived on time and was told they were understaffed and it would get to us in half hour. Would have preferred they didn't accept the order if they wouldn't be able to fulfill on time. That being said, I ordered the Chocolate Dipped Indulgence Platter and it was delish.  Gone within a matter of minutes."

"Our guests were delighted with their afternoon coffee break, all sweets were delicious."
"Edible Arrangements called me 2 times to say they would be late and finally an hour after they were suppose to be there, they said they were not coming because it was too far.  EzCater has refunded me but it completely messed up a planned event for a physician office and it was too late for me to make other arrangements."
Very nice.  I wish Edible arrangements would include my name when they deliver so my customer would know who it’s from.
Best Snack!! The chocolate covered fruits were a big hit! Definitely will use again soon! Delicious!!

"Cheesecakes were delightful and the strawberries were very fresh.  However, the cookies were very tough. The wrapping and ribbon was very festive, nice for the occasion."
The delivery driver was professional and did a great job! Food was delicious as always!
"Totally forgot to deliver the food today. At least EZ Cater made sure my credit card wasn’t going to be charged. For the record, this is the first time Edible Arrangements has slipped up with me as a customer. I will give them another chance."
"Absolutely love Edible Arrangements, will order them again and again!!"
I was surprised the fruit was not big fresh strawberries. They were small and not beautiful strawberries. The presentation was a plastic cup with strawberries inside. Not enticing. Plus they arrived in some torn used boxes. Not impressed. I am used to a beautiful presentation in another state.
Expensive for what you get. It was very good
"Delicious! Everything was great, nice presentation and incredibly yummy!"
"We got the individual  chocolate covered apples and strawberries, and the fruit cups. Everyone loved them! Everything was fresh and individually packaged."
Was good as usual.  Office loves them

I looked forward to ordering again soon. The strawberries were heavenly
We ordered their variety of fruit tray.  Some had chocolate and we had some without.  It was a great addition to our reception.

This was a total hit! The staff loved it !
"Delivered way too early so when I arrived the office had already got into the food, I had no time to set out marketing materials. Awkward. Stressful. Also no time to set out the plates, drinks, napkins I had to shlep since they don’t sell /offer any.  Then, the trays were too small and items were scrunched in and damaged. Looked terrible. Disappointing.  Really not recommending. EZ cater did address my issues and were totally professional."
Every thing was good and on time. yup

"If I could give 1/2 star I would.  I ordered for a meeting 4 days in advance and requested delivery 2 hours earlier than the start of my meeting.  I reached out to ez cater customer service - who were awesome they were told several times by Edible Arrangements that the driver was nearby and would be at my office in a few minutes.  This was not the case, then I received two telephone calls from Gordon at EA stating that he couldn't reach the driver but that he was nearby and should be here any moment.  The final call with Gordon was about 1:35pm and I still have no platter.  I will never order from EA again, they clearly aren't able to deliver on the orders they accept, yet they had no issue with putting payment through and stating that the order was completed and delivered.  Gordon did offer to send another platter out that I would get in another 1.5 hours.  No thanks and buyer beware.  Thank God I also placed an order through another vendor on ezcater Small Cakes - who delivered early"
They office was very excited about the multiple platters.  They delivered too early so I didn’t see the food before the office obliterated it.
Love the fruits and chocolate and everything. Always a big hit

The fruit arrived on time and was very good.
This fruit was a huge hit! However just a few things to keep in mind if you order the trays specified for 30 guests.  One tray is not dipped it is just fruit also there is no way this will work for 30 . I had 20  guests and there was barely enough.
What a lovely afternoon treat. Enjoyed the easy grab and go cups.

cant go wrong with chocolate and fruit. great service.
"My order was delivered on time and was so delicious. It was so easy to just place the pre-arranged platter on the serving table and lift the cover off for guests. My guests and I enjoyed the fruit very much.

The strawberries are NOT like the ones you get at the supermarket... each is sweet, juicy, and blemish-free. Such high quality and I will definitely be a repeat customer."
Great great great food as always for the office
"They accepted the order for a 10:30 am delivery. I received a call about an hour before stating that it could not be delivered by 10:30 am and instead it would be a delivery window that goes into the afternoon. I asked them to cancel the order because I needed everything by 11:30 am. EZ cater confirmed it was cancelled and then the delivery person ended up showing up in the afternoon. I gave 2 stars because the food is good, but you cannot trust the delivery time."
Order arrived so fresh! Everything was delicious! Will order again!
"Ordered the chocolate covered strawberry cones and they arrived so nicely packaged, perfect for an office event where we want to be covid-safe."

Really poor experience with Edible arrangements…  delivery driver was 30 minutes late and on top of that didn’t even bring the food to the conference room where I was. Dropped the food off with the receptionist and made her carry the heavy box of food by herself All the way back. Piss poor service and absolutely unacceptable showing up 30 minutes late. Will not use again…

"WOW! Just gorgeous! Ordered for an end of year celebration and they did not disappoint. I did end up adding extra chocolate truffles to the trays, as one can never have enough chocolate, but overall, it was exactly what my manager asked for, down o the ""little cakes""."

"The food was not delivered on time. It was supposed to be delivered by 12:45 PM.  At 1:30 I called the store and they explained that there was an issue with the driver and it would be delivered by 2:30 PM.  After my appointment was over,  I left the doctors office snd went  by their store at 2:40 PM and it was still not delivered. Very embarrassing for me because I did not provide a meal as promised. I do believe it was delivered later in the day but again not acceptable."

Absolutely horrible do not have this place for deliver if time is at all of any concern to you this is the second time I have ordered a delivery they were supposed to be here at 10 AM I ordered the three days ago so they had plenty of notice it is 1130 and it is still not here this food was for a meeting which was at 11 o’clock which would’ve given me an entire hour to get everything ready instead the meeting is going to be over before it’s even going to arrive !! beware do not use them for delivery if you wanted it to be there at a specific time !!

"The menu online is not correct. I was told it changed months ago by the store manager. Had to spend over an hour the day of the order trying to ""fix"" the order after part of the order was canceled due to the menu not being correct and items being canceled and not replaced.  Had I not checked my e-mail, I would have never known-no call. Very stressful and very expensive experience-would not recommend!  I Will not use again."

Great job! Office loved as an afternoon snack!
The Fruit was amazing and very fresh. Was well liked by all. It was nicely displayed on platter.

"Delivery was great and on time. However, they charge extra for utensils and we ordered for 15 people and only got enough for 9. It's disappointing to pay extra for what other caterers provide for free and then not even get enough."
"I called to confirm delivery to the DR office, they said there was no note attached to let them know who it was from and the no thank you that I had wrote out.  If I wouldn’t have called they never would have know I sent it.  Could have been a giant waste of money to send if there is no thank you note attached."
The treats from here are so yummy and loved by all.  Great experience!
This was the first time I used Edible Arrangements. It was great and the cookies were awesome!
"Yum! This was a hit.
Delivery Driver was confused about who was sending this order as a surprise but the staff figured it out. :("
They were wonderful to work with and I would recommend them in the future!
"Terrible experience - ordered this to come at 8:45AM. At 9:10AM, I called EZcater as I had been waiting on the order. They put me on hold for about 10 mins as the customer rep from EZcater said he tried multiple times to call Edible Arrangements. He said they weren't answering so he was leaving voicemails and e-mails but couldn't get in touch. Finally, at 9:40AM I've given up on it as it's now an hour late. The receptionist at my building let me know it arrived. I ordered 2 platters of fruit - did not receive any serving utensils/tongs for either platter. I also ordered and paid for utensils (plates/napkins/forks) on my order, but naturally, did not receive those either. Overall, this has been a terrible experience by Edible Arrangements."
Staff loved the fruit covered with chocolate and the selection
A bit pricey but makes a great impact and my customers sometimes view it as a healthier option to baked goods. Always a welcome change to my customers. Will use again.
Everyone loved the Edible Arrangements at our team happy hour! The fruits were fresh and the delivery was timely and professional. Everyone rushed to these first and they were gone in minutes!

"Amazing presentation and fresh fruit is beautiful, strawberries were a big hit"
Last minute order. Exactly what I was looking for. Fruit was super good and super fresh!
Delivered for free because they switched the store last minute.
Chocolate covered strawberries and cookies are  always a fun treat from Edible Arrangement.
I got fruit and pastries to celebrate the office birthdays for February and it was quite good! Fruit very fresh and tasty!
Delicious treats!  The chocolate strawberries were wonderful!!
"Order arrived 2 hours late!!!  ezCater called Edible Arrangements and Edible could not find my order.  They only spoke about how they had 27 orders for today and did not know where mine was.  Totally useless and will never order from them again, whether for meetings or personal."
Such delicious arrangements thank you so much for everything
"They delivered to the wrong address so it arrived very late. However, strawberries are always delicious"
This was incredible and a huge hit for my office! Can’t wait to use them again!
The choc covered strawberries were amazing and so many!
Great fresh fruit!!!! The office loved it!! I will definitely use them again!!!
Loved the flower fruit arrangement - would def order again!
Staff loved the arrangement from EA for valentines day!
"I was a little disappointed that the display was not as neat as usual but they can't all be perfect. Over all, I was able to fix it and all was well."
My arrangement was perfect! Fresh and beautiful. The recipient loved it. I will order again.
Office adored the fruit bouquet! Will order again!

"Was beautiful and huge!
Ordered for a going away party and it was our beautiful centerpiece!

Perfect assortments for anytime - company loved them
Great healthy choice for my office and they loved the chocolate covered.
they used doordash and doordash person was very unprofessional and I was suppose to receive a full refund and never did. Will not order again
Edible arrangements delivered as usual. I order from them often and never disappointed. Was enjoyed by all.
I received the Edible Arrangements delivery as expected and it was beautiful and delicious. I will order from them again!
Amazing choice for our break snack during all day meetings! Everyone loved the assortment
Always a welcome change to my customers. They like it as its healthier than baked goods. Wish it was a bit less expensive though for what you get.
The pineapples were sweet but soggy.  Trays were smaller in person than on line. Order arrived too early so most of the fruit was gone by the time of my scheduled arrival so I missed time with the staff.  I didn’t catch that there were napkins/plates/utensils provided by EA with the delivery.
Great spread. On time and friendly. Always tasty
Always a welcome change to my customers. A bit pricey but makes a great impact and my customers sometimes view it as a healthier option to baked goods.
Thank you so much! They loved the fresh food
We love this company for executive meetings - such presentable tasty snacks
edible arrangements always makes a great dessert for the office!
Everyone loved the fruit and ate it right up!
"I’ve used this company regularly for the past year & always had stellar service in many cities across Texas. Today, (again for the 4th time now in 2 weeks), Edible Arrangements did not live up to minimum standards...food was 45 minutes late (despite being ordered a couple of days beforehand-not a last minute order). When the food was delivered, the delivery driver (who I’m told was the owner of the store) showed up, parked in a handicap parking spot, and took the tray in. She then proceeded to stay taking up a handicap parking spot for another 5 minutes (I watched as someone who needed that spot had to park elsewhere). I’m very disappointed in this caterer for many reasons. Although I really like treating my customers with their fruit platters because they’re delicious, I will unlikely use them again because of such poor customer service lately. As stated before, it has been now 4 locations with similar poor customer service & very late deliveries."
Last minute request was handled perfectly! We will order again.
This couldn’t be easier. Office loves this surprise treat!
The food looked beautiful and tasted really great
Great Treat for the office snack during a workshop. Will be ordering again!
"perfect presentation, we don't order this often so it's a real treat to our associates."
perfect for our office birthday celebration. Ordered a tray of chocolate covered fruit
Staff really enjoyed fruit platters and appreciated a healthy snack.
On time and looked delicious! I know our staff member was very appreciative.
"Food was great, however the delivery was scheduled for 2:15 and the driver arrived at 1:06. Was not prepared for the delivery as I had no cool place to store it until we were ready to eat."
"Wonderful presentation. I'm not a big fan of white chocolate, but the white and chocolate covered bananas were delicious."
"The food is delicious. The presentation of the food is very nice. I’ve been ordering from Edible Arrangements for over a year now, and have had great service, however, the last two orders have been delivered very late-40-75 minutes after requested delivery time, despite having confirmation of order & delivery acceptance. The delivery driver was very nice to the staff on both occasions, however, on this particular delivery, the driver was confused as to who the delivery was for (an office) and he had the office call me to see if it was for a particular individual or for the whole staff. The service has just not been great for my last 2 orders."
"Driver was lost, called and gave me a heads up. I appreciated the communication. Beautiful arrangement. The office was very happy."
The day turned out great. The fruit plates were delivered on time and the fruit was delicious!

Nurse loved the arrangement for her bday!! Thank you Edible Arrangements for taking the order the night before!
Always amaZing delivery driver was super nice thanks so much
It was a good snack but not a lot of food for what you pay. Office likes that it was something different.
So good! Thank you again for such a great treat. Everyone loved it.
Always a big hit! Great for a short notice pickup!
Delivery was on-time. Food was fresh & a nice presentation. There was less on the platter than historical orders.
It was a beautiful display and it tasted delicious!
Everything was on time.  They even called to verify that they could leave it at the door when no one was home.
"Great arrangement, I only wish I had ordered more because it was gone too quickly!"
Thank you for adding my personal note to the delivery!

On time delivery which was a delight for the entire office.
A great office treat with variety of fruit and chocolate.
Delivery on time. The fruits taste good as always.

"driver called me asking where to go then again when he told the office my name for delivery, a lot of unnecessary confision. obviously the office order was for them with their name on it so why was he calling me saying he cant deliver it .really annoying"
easy option office enjoyed it delivery was easy
Tricky location if you are picking it up because there isn’t much parking downtown.

No plates or utensils with delivery just an FYI
Beautiful trays of fruit that were enjoyed at our office. Thank you!
"Perfect arrangement and loved by all, highly reccommended"
"That was the perfect snack, if its in the budget!"
"No longer made the item placed. Asked me what I wanted to do. Suggested to make comparable and close to same price. Although it was a lot cheaper, which is great, so was the tray. 
Still delicious and the chocolate covered pineapple and green apples were a hit."
"Edible Arrangement called and said they read my order wrong and was over an hour late in making my order. 

The delivery woman was unprofessional and did not read the address. She kept calling but I could not answer since I was hosting a meeting using my cell phone as the speaker. Finally I called her back and she wanted me to come downstairs to pick up the delivery because she was in the wrong building. She did not read the address, which told her exactly which building and floor to go through. She basically just showed up at the hospital and expected me to meet her in front. She was unprofessional and was over an hour late. Will never order again."
This was my first order and it did not disappoint! Beautiful and it did not hurt my boss’s waistline.
The thanksgiving assortment with the little turkey was so good
Food was amazing they loved it. Thank you so much
"Candied apples are fresh and amazing, chocolate dipped strawberries are wonderful as well"
On time and perfect surprised for office. Do the trio box.
Everyone at the firm loved it! Great arrangements!
They delivered very early so I was in a meeting and could not meet them. When I received them the trays were in a bag and the bag was too large so the trays fell to the side and were disorganized. The fruit was fresh and delicious though.
Always delicious especially the apples.   A good combo of indulgent and nutritious
Beautifully packaged and everything was so good. Everyone was so excited for the special treats!
the staff was so happy with this. I will order from them again! thank you
Beautiful trays and the office loved them! I will definitely order again.

"Always a hit at our monthly meetings, arrived well packaged and on time"
This was so cute and so good! Loved the fruit.
"Ordered easily, arrived on time and was perfect for the occasion."
We had a miscommunication on the delivery but Edible Arrangements came through.  I will definitely use the fruit arrangements/platters again as everyone loved the different options.
"Delicious, fruit is fresh and all looks elegant."
They raved about the fruit and how fresh it was
I wasn't aware that their hours of operation would impact the requested delivery time.  It arrived closer to noon than 10 AM.  Luckily the individual it was meant for was still on campus so she was able to get it.  No one notified me it would arrive later.  I called and that was how I learned of the delay in the packages delivery time.  Packaging and presentation was great!
Thnaks for the wonderful fruit. Our team loved it. Willl get again.
"We got a really cute thanksgiving themed edible arrangement as a PM snack for training and it was a huge hit!

Always good just wish they supplied plates or cups
"Professional, delicious and on time. The whole company loved it!"
Candied apples and dipped strawberries we loved. Excellent treat!
"The fruit is always great but it arrived 40 minutes late for a morning meeting of 200 ppl so that was disappointing. Also, it would be so helpful if they provided serving utensils- even as a misc item to purchase."
Office loved the food.  Highly recommended.  Had to comeback to pick up because it wasn’t ready yet.  A minor inconvenience
Delicious and beautiful presentation. Fruit is always top quality.
Edible Arrangements is always a perfect gift for a colleague on any occasion.
"Always Fresh, beautiful, tasty, and on-time.  I say it every time! They have never disappointed me. We use them every month!"
Accommodated a last minute quantity and delivery time change. Ordered the caramel apples which were a hit at the office!

A great option for a small crowd. Delicious and beautiful.
"Only half of the order was delivered, so the other half, once they were aware of their error, was late to the meeting. 
Not the end of the world, but disappointing considering the price.
Fruit was lovely, though."
We got caramel apples and a chocolate fruit platter for a coworker’s birthday and they were a huge hit.  The apples were almost too big.  The fruit platter was gone in a flash.  Delivery driver was just super super sweet
Edible Arrangements are always such a huge hit! We keep ordering from them because the product and the delivery are always on point!
Food arrived 30 minutes before scheduled time. I arrived to find my customers grabbed a few treats and went back to their offices. The ones that did come back (a 2nd time) had to stop work to speak with me.
Nice presentation - could use more variety. Will use again.
"Had a bit of an issue with the pick up, but they ended up delivering it for me instead and it worked out great!"
Was delivered on time with friendly service.  Fruit was very good
Delicious treats! HIghly recommend for an office events!
Office delivery. Sweet chocolate dipped strawberries for the win!
"Thank you! This was simple and easy, appreciate it!"
"A little disappointed as there was some miscommunication regarding our order being delivered. Luckily, ezCater was super helpful and got everything straightened out. Thanks again!"
"Office was very pleased with the delicious, fresh, beautiful chocolate fruit snack."
I wasn't too pleased with them. I order 2 fruit trays and for the price I thought they would of been big trays but they were small. Definitely over priced.  Won't be ordering from them anymore.
Beautiful and delicious. This is a perfect celebration treat!

I just popped them onto the banquet table and when one was empty(which didn't take long) I put another one down and then another and another! Everyone was wondering where they were coming from! Made the event spectacular!"
Such a treat to my customers and always fresh!
This is a hit with offices and provides a delicious treat while still being on the healthy side!

Edible arrangement snack cups of chocolate covered dipped fruit is delicious. Everyone enjoyed them very much.
"The fruit bouquet was perfect and the presentation was lovely. My only complaint was the strawberries were tiny, I remember them to be bigger before and the cute little individual dipped  strawberry cups kept falling over and the berries went everywhere- I would just recommend them to transport them a bit more securely :) other than that, I would order these again!!!!"

I always order both dipped and fresh, but the dipped always disappears first (even though we always have people who are on diets! )Something for everyone and I am always a star for ordering from them.  Don't hesitate to order! They have something for every occasion you could think of, and even something for no occasion-just because!"
The chocolate covered strawberries and bananas weren’t individually wrapped making it messy to give to my customers.

I called was told that even though they accepted and confirmed the order it was not made.  I was told that they would create the order and have it here by 11 am.  I adjusted the food timing plans and again no call no show. Very disappointed. needless to say, I won't be trying again."

Although I received confirmation from ezCater that everything was ok, the driver told the receptionist he couldn't take it back and would be elsewhere at 1:30pm. I promptly called ezCater and was assured follow up action would be taken."

The arrangement was beautiful! The tray that says it feeds 10 feeds maybe half that if you are lucky so order extra!

Great treat for my offices. They love the freshness of the fruit!
"The strawberries were amazing, everyone loved them BUT I ordered 33 and only received 30, which was very disappointing. There were extra cups in the three boxes, but they were empty with no chocolate covered strawberries inside so it was confusing."
The fruit was fresh and the office loved it.
Was left with someone not even from our office. Should have contacted the number given upon arrival.
"I got it as an accent to other snacks, but was not impressed with the way it looked.  Fruit tasted great, but the presentation fell short, which is not ideal since that's what you're really paying for.  I think the transport is tough on the trays. I bet the 'floral' arrangements are better."
We love Edible Arrangements!  There's always a great variety of fruits in each display.
"On time, and fresh! It was for an office baby shower, so it was perfect! Staff loved it."
"This location is getting much better. I had some timing issues in the past, but they have completely turned around and were great this time"
Thank you so much they always love this treat

Wonderful fruit trays large enough for a summer outdoor party
For the price of the fruit trays I was disappointed by the quality of the fruit. Melons and pineapple that weren’t totally ripe. The fruit tray from the honey baked ham store was better.
They took a picture of the arrangement.  It was well received.  Great job!
The best Snack ever!  It all looked and tasted delicious. Thank you
Great presentation and good mix of fresh fruit and chocolate covered fruit

Great afternoon treat that team enjoyed they came on time and was professional
"They came too early so I wasn't onsite.  The delivery person called at around 5:15 but my order wasn't until 5:45.  She left it at the door, but by the time I got there, it was gone.  Luckily it wasn't life or death... just disappointing."
I wasnt impressed with the presentation of the fruits for an Exec mtg.  The strawberries for the chocolate covered were old and gross.  It wasnt presentable for a mtg full of executives

We love edible arrangements.  It's a great way to show someone they're appreciated.  And there's always enough to share with the office.
Pretty small tray for price.  They did like it but I was surprised at small  tray size for cost
Love incredible edible arrangements! Their dipped fruit trays are amazing and there are never leftovers! Thank you for making my events top-notch!
No one does fruit and fruit arrangements like Edible Arrangements.  Always fresh and always good.
Chocolate dipped fruit was amazing!!! it made our employee feel very special. Will order again!
I love this fresh fruit! The chocolate dipped fruit is even better!
Best fresh fruit ever! This fruit is always a great treat for anyone
Perfection as usual. You can always count on Edible Arrangements.
"This is great when you need a gift or arrangement delivered.  Everyone loves the fruit but it is expensive and the menu is limited - you can't add chocolate covered things to the birthday arrangement, etc."
Edible Arrangements is always a huge hit! Love the freshness and variety of fruit.
The best treats one could ever want. My personal favorite! Thank you.
"The chocolate covered caramel apples were huge!!  Each apple is individually wrapped, and the presentation is beautiful. Apples arrived in a thermal bag so the chocolate did not melt. Staff loved the treats!"
Great and Yummy Fruit Platter! Wish there was more fruit for what you pay. The Delivery fee was a bit much for a small fruit platter.
Very good fruit and all very well thank you we will order from you in the future.
Delicious and made to fit our special order
Loved the edible arrangements always an office favorite
Arrive on time and the call center loved the arrangement. It was a nice surprise and I will use them again.

The driver was very rude and was not customer service oriented.
Arrived on time. The chocolate apples are the best!
So happy to have Edible Arrangements as a catering option. Ordered chocolate dipped fruit trays and the crowd enjoyed! Very fresh and delicious.
"Everything about the order and delivery went fine.... I just find EA to be a bit too expensive... I knew this when I purchased it, but you can get fruit trays from various vendors for less.  They did provide what I ordered and it was delivered ontime."
I ordered for a co-worker who had twins.   Had it delivered to his home. He said it was awesome and a big hit!
Everyone loved the fruit! Great afternoon snack.
"The fruit was perfectly ripe and fresh!  There was a good mixture of dipped and not-dipped fruits, and the platter arrangements were very nice.  Delivery was a bit early, but that was okay because it was for dessert and didn't need to be kept warm."
Always a good dessert options. Office was happy
Office loved the chocolate covered strawberries. The packaging is very cute.
"We loved it, thank you. Great afternoon treat"
My customers have been loving this great healthy treat
"It was less fruit than I was expecting, but it arrived on time and folks were happy"
Why have just fruit when you can have them by Edible? The chocolate dipped were scrumptious.
It was  a perfect afternoon snack during a meeting. Everyone raved over the choice!
WOW! This was absolutely amazing. Very very good!
Perfect for sending gifts to our offices across the state.
The chocolate strawberry cups were great. So good and on time
Love the presentation it was perfect as a thank you gift to an office
YUM! These strawberries were amazing! Super sweet and a perfect treat for anyone in the office. 5 min late.
Great presentation and every piece was perfectly fresh!
"I love that they bring fruit to the office.However they only seem to bring green apples and oranges? Which is what most people in my office don't eat. I wish they offered more variety with fruit replenishment such as more seasonal fruit like peaches or plums, pears, apricots or mangos something more fun. I also wish they brought red apples over the green apples."
Perfect addition to an all office meeting for those who want a healthy alternative to “sweets”.  Will order again.
Thank you so much. They loved it all
Was a great touch as a thank you sent to someone. Delivered on time and the arrangement was great! They followed special instructions!

Left order for a 3-4 time frame at 1130 am!!
The delivery arrived early and food was delicious.
The fruit is always good and everything is in order.  Only issue I have ever had is that they consistently come 30 minutes or more before the delivery time i request.  Can make timing for the lunch difficult.
It was good!!! I just wish they had a wider variety of mixed fruit.
Edible arrangements beautiful basket that is very appreciated

"Twice dipped chocolate bananas and chocolate dipped apples,  so good in a hot afternoon for a meeting snack. I’m still trying to figure out what the per person “feeds” is with what is received. I’ve ordered twice and have not gotten the same quantity. It’s really good though so I’m going to keep trying to figure it out."
Dipped apples and strawberry cups are always a favorite
I got fruit platters with dip and chocolate dipped fruit. Office loved having something healthy and it was perfect afternoon snack/dessert.
Love incredible edible arrangements! Their dipped fruit trays are amazing and there are never leftovers! Thank you for making my events top-notch!
The office loved this order. Delicious! Will be back.
D.E.L.I.C.I.O.U.S!!!!!!  Thank you for a wonderful display as well as wonderful taste.  We will need to do this again!

The office said the arrangement was tasty and enjoyed.
The office said the arrangement was tasty and enjoyed.
The office loved the chocolate covered fruits. It was very fresh and delicious. This is such a great treat for the staff.
They were great and were gone very quick!
"The quality of my order was great but they were over a half an hour late in their arrival, which was a bit of a hiccup since this was the dessert for a lunch that had our CEO in it."
"My clients enjoyed the individual cups of chocolate dipped strawberrie, nice change up!"
"Very pricey for a snack, but delicious! I saw their paperwork and even though I selected a delivery time of 2:45 their paperwork said 2:00-3:00 delivery window. I would have been very disappointed if they arrived right at 2:00 because all of my attendees would have gotten their snack without me having the chance to have a business discussion with them. Just FYI."
Always delicious and a hit with our office
"Everything was great! Best fruit and chocolate treats in town, yum! Food arrived on time and no complaints! Will definitely use for future orders!"
Edible arrangements were perfect and had something for everyone. Wanted something healthy but delicious for the team and this was the perfect choice.
"They arrived 30 minutes later than expected. Edible Arrangements had a 1 hour delivery window of 11-12 and I had requested 11:30 AM (for a  12 PM start) as a FYI.  But the cuteness and taste of the individual chocolate covered apples  made up for it. EZCater ordering page said 1 pack feeds 10 people, but there were only 8 individual packages as a FYI. Don't let that stop you from getting these,  just order within an hour window of when you need them and plan that it 1 pack feeds 8 not 10. That's why I still gave 5 stars!"
Very pleased with the service and the food was great.
Such a nice arrangement very pleased so pretty
I ordered kind of last min and they delivered beautifully! Thank you!!
Amazing everyone loved it so much it was great
Such an awesome snack. he chocolate covered fruit is really Delish.

"Fruit tray was so fresh and a welcome change from other ""sweets"""
"Very nice surprise for the office and staff! It was gone in a second,"
Awesome treat.  Would order again  delivery was perfectly timed.
The product was good but arrived 2 hours past the scheduled delivery time.
Office loved the strawberries. Great office snack.   Will use again
Great healthy option. We loved the white chocolate.
We tried this for our monthly birthday celebration instead of the usual cupcakes and it was a huge hit.
Very good choice and the office loved it so much
"The fruit is always fresh and everyone from the office always enjoys the little treat.  The driver is always early, but we do have a refrigerator to keep everything cold.  Will be ordering from again."
"Awesome service, lady at the store was super helpful. Beautiful arrangement.?"
"Presentable, on time, delicious, everyone enjoyed.  Will definitely order again.  Only complaint was fruit wasn't very sweet, but I think he has to be a little hard to get the arrangement properly and not soggy."
Great afternoon snack! Staff loved the fruit with chocolate!
Huge hit. Delicious fresh fruit. The chocolate cover apples are amazing.
"we received food, food was good. service was good."

Office loved the arrangement and they said it was delicious!
"As always, perfect experience with Edible Arrangements.  They are always so helpful and delicious."
"Fresh, wonderful arrangement. Staff even took the time to leave a condolence note (ordered for a wake service)"
"I ordered the Berry bunny platter- No bunny :(, and share the love and slice of sweet fruit.  Everything was wonderful and fresh but disappointed I had no bunny.  That's why I ordered that platter."
The order was 2 hours early. Staff were not accommodating
"So delicious, great healthy snack. We loved it"
"I was very disappointed.  I gave enough time for delivery.  Needed it for a meeting with the Executive Staff and 10 minutes before the meeting, I checked the tracking and it showed ""Delivered"" when I was waiting in the lobby.  I contacted EzCater and they tracked it down.  There was a misunderstanding about the delivery time.  I had to run to the nearest dessert store and was late setting up the afternoon snacks in the meeting.  They called back and asked if I still wanted the order delivered later in the day or the next day.  I just cancelled.  I'm sure it was a misunderstanding but I received a confirmation throughout the day from EzCater regarding the status so I don't understand how it was forgotten.
Forgotten Order"
The fruit was very fresh. The staff loved the presentation.
This was a hit with the office and gave us a healthier option when it comes to sweets and treats.
"Fantastic!  Dessert was so well received, set up was easy."
Choc covered strawberries were amazing and on time!
"Perfect for every occasion! The fruit trays are so beautiful! The fruit is always fresh! Everyone says they want to eat healthy for parties, but it seems the chocolate covered fruit trays always empty first! LOL I love being able to get trays for meetings!"
The fruit and presentation were top notch!  Our guests loved the chocolate covered berries.
Everybody perks up for chocolate covered fruit in pretty shapes!  It makes any meeting feel like an occasion.
"On time, beautifully done and delicious! Will order again!"
Delivery was requested at 3:00 and fruit was delivered in the morning.
"There was an issue with communication between Edible Arrangements and EZ Cater. This is not something I will fault Edible Arrangements with because it seemed like a 2-way street, and the manager was kind enough to hop in the car and deliver my items personally as soon as he found out about the missed order."
"The most beautiful fruit platter. So well arranged, everything was fresh!"
Ordered a bouquet and it was absolutely beautiful! The fruit was fresh and delicious! Huge hit with the group!
Fresh and delicious. Everyone was surprised and excited.
These guys do a great job and everyone loves the fruit.  Great healthy option.
The cups of chocolate dipped fruit is delicious. Was a bit pricy but was a really delicious treat. Chocolate covered strawberries are fabulous.
Everyone loved this! I was disappointed that there were no leftovers.
A nice change of pace from cookies and desserts for an afternoon snack
Wonderful service. Great follow up. Great service.   Great value.
I love ordering from here and so does my team when I do. Great platters every time. I wish the plain fruit came in larger chunks.
Great food great service great food great atmosphere great o
The fruit was 45 minutes late which was unfortunate since we had to jump into a meeting right after that so we weren't really able to enjoy the food.
Easy to deal with out of state and the arrangement made it on time with short notice!
Delicious and healthy perk to our day. Thanks!
"Everything was great with the order except it was delivered before 11am. We had to move people's lunches in the fridge to make space. It wasn't a big deal, but I just don't know why you put in a time if they are going to deliver it hours early."
"Fantastic chocolate covered fruit, and fresh fruit platter cut into fun shapes. Made for a fun and interesting afternoon treat for the staff meeting, nothing was leftover!"
"I ordered the chocolate dipped strawberry cones for a staff meeting and what a hit they were. It was so nice that they're individually packaged, so fresh and delish. Highly recommend."
"Everyone in the office was happy, will definitely order again!"
A little on the expensive side but everyone loved the nice surprise. The arrangement was beautiful and delivered very promptly.
One word... chocolate! And the chocolate is good at that... wish I could eat every day
fruit was beautifully displayed. the order did arrive a little to early
"Perfect sweet, yet healthy treat for the office"
Venue was expensive for the amount of fruit you received...and the quality of the strawberries was poor. Presentation could have been better. But taste was good.
The fruit was fresh and delicious.  Everyone loved the chocolate dipped fruits.  The bananas and apples were a huge hit.
A really nice treat! The cones allow staff to take it to their station to enjoy. Really great!
Fresh fruit as always.  People always appreciate a healthy option for meeting food.
"I ordered a platter, the slice of Slice of Sweet Fruit, and the pieces where cut up so small, almost at it was left over bits of fruit.  I will not order this platter again."
This was a perfect experience. I really enjoyed working with them and made a new order right away.
All so delicious as always we are so satisfied we will continue to order.
On time delivery and fresh fruit.  The staff was very pleased and excited.  Will order from again!  Great deals too!
Birthday celebration surprise for those that do not want to eat cake or cookies.
Our office loved it for a light sweet snack for Birthdays.
Delivery on time and office said fruit was very fresh.
"On time, perfectly ripe, and delicious!!! This was such a fun treat for our office (we paired with champagne/sparkling cider) -- it ended up being a great afternoon ""break."" There was a little something for everyone between all the trays we ordered."
wonderful arrangements and great quality fruits and chocolate
Very fresh fruit. Perfect arrangement for group. Everyone loved as a morning snack!
Food was good and the delivery was on time.  I wish the tray was bigger.
These fruit arrangements were fantastic. The office loved it for their afternoon snack.
"I work with a very picky doctor's office- they love afternoon snacks but don't like cookies, brownies and unhealthy selections. They were very impressed with Edible Arrangements. Nice selection of fresh fruits, laid out nicely with all the utensils provided. A healthy snack in the afternoon?  Great idea from Edible Arrangements!  Priced right too."
"Fruit was juicy and fresh
Will reorder for sure"
Excellent excellent food and service is great food
What everyone wants!!! Their trays are amazing and such a huge hit!
This was so good - everyone loved the fruit. We brought in lunch from another caterer and then has the trays from Edible Arrangements as the dessert. I wish they had more options as far as the platters that include the chocolate dipped bananas but people gobbled it up.
"The apple were such a big hit, everyone loved them."
fruit was delicious and office enjoyed fruit instead of heavy dessert
fruit was fresh and ready on time - office appreciated a healthy option
fresh fruit was a nice alternative from typical heavy desserts
The office was very thankful for this arrangement.
First time order.  So fun! We ordered as a treat for a meeting. The trays of treats were devoured instantly!
Fun office snack. Fruit was fresh and pretty! I will definitely use them again!!
"Fantastic as always! Deliverer was very professional, and I always love supporting local businesses. Will order again."
each fruit platter is said to be enough for about 10 but I highly doubt that's the case. In my experience it serves 5 people ( the 35$ fruit platter).
Edible Arrangements never disappoints. Such a perfect display and heathy too!
"Great treat for a new office! Presentation was great, and they loved it!"
Great snack for our celebration and arrived promptly.
Perfect office treat for celebrating birthdays! A good switch from having a lot of cakes and other sweets in the office.
"How can you wrong with chocolate covered anything?!? The fruits were sweet and delicious. My favorite had to be the choco-covered bananas. I hate bananas, but the way these were prepared were absolutely scrumptious! Would definitely order again!"
Was amazing! My first order and most certainly will not be my last
"I wish the orders could have been a little bigger, but thats not Edible Arrangements fault. Next time ill order more :)"
"Asked for plates and forks , they left no plates ."
"Fantastic, great presentation and everything was eaten in minutes."
Despite calling two times to confirm delivery time.  The food was still 45 minutes late.
Fruit was a hit!  Nice little snack boxes-would definitely do again!
Arrived on time. Smaller arrangement. Staff loved being able to pick between the different kinds of chocolate dipped fruit.
Food was fresh and tasty.  Delivery was on time and professional.   Value is a bit under par
Please order extra chocolate covered fruit because it goes fast.
Food is always fresh and the drivers are always professional!
"Team enjoyed the snack for one of their meetings, the platters were a huge hit!!"

Small amount for the amount paid.  Almost an hour late with delivery.
The arrangement came on time and the fruit was fresh!
"Fruit was tasty! Each platter says it serves 10 people,  it it didn’t seem like it would."
"big hit, easy to freeze if leftovers, and popular"
A big hit. Fresh and something for everyone
The treats are good but they were an hour late
"yummy yummy!  on time, fresh and the tray was overflowing!"
Always a healthier option and nice difference from cookies.
This was my first time using Edible Arrangements. They did an amazing job.
I was completely satisfied! I will be returning.
This is awesome! Thank you for being a caterer!
"Food was great and very professional. We are in a larger office building, and delivery person didn't have a cart so he had to make to runs to get the snacks to our office which took some more time.  Making delivery slightly late."
The fruit was delicious. A nice change for a late afternoon meeting.  Delivery was on time.
Love the snack cups. Healthy snack and the office loved it. Delivery right on time
Very pleased with order.  Will order again.  Order was on time.
Will order again.  Has everything ready to go
Had order ready to go and would order again
"delivery was a little on the expensive side, and need more options on menu"
Delicious as always. Ordered this as a going away party treat for a person doing Whole 30!
"Pretty presentation and it was good. A couple of the staff members said the fruit tasted kind of old. But mostly everyone liked it. I had delivery set for 1:45pm and when I arrived at that time, it was 1/2 gone.  The staff had already come and gone."
Great snack but they didn't accommodate my special request - was a simple/easy request so it seems that there is no room for customization. Would have been great if they communicated that as well.
The fruit was so fresh and beautiful. The delivery driver very pleasant. We look forward to using Edible Arrangement's. again soon
Arrived wrapped wonderfully and temp controlled. This was a big hit for the afternoon meeting - a great way to mix healthy and treat all in one.
Edibles Arrangements never disappoints! Great choice for an afternoon snack for my office.
All the fruit edibles were so delicious we will be ordering from you more often very good and well design Lady that came to deliver very friendly.
"Edible has been amazing every time I order. They arrive on-time, exactly as ordered. I love the trays for my events, everyone does. They rave about them. I am so happy they started making trays too!"
It was very good and nice to do something different for dessert.
Delicious chocolate covered strawberries as a treat are always good!
Fruit was amazing and nice change from usual snacks.  Nice afternoon treat
Huge hit! Choc pineapple is insane! So good!
Everyone was raving about the fruit trays and said it was an awsome change from just plain fruit or plain chocolate to combining them both.
Did not know they delivered! So fun to order and surprise the office with the treat of freshly made chocolate strawberries. Came in a to-go style servings in a big box that was wrapped up really nice in cellophane! Great change of pace!
Everything very fresh and delicious.  Beautiful presentation. My offices love the chocolate covered fruit platter and the fresh fruit platter.
"DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS LOCATION - they deserve a ‘zero’ star review! 
I ordered for an office of 26 people. It was supposed to be delivered at 2:30, but didn’t show up until 2:45pm. Only a small portion of my order was delivered and I was informed almost an hour later that the missing parts of the order were not available and were not coming.  

The fruit was overly ripe and many pieces had small holes through the center - it looks like they pulled fruit off of skewers from an old “bouquet” and chopped it up to make my fruit tray.  The strawberries that were dipped in chocolate were wilted and the tops were white.  The chocolate covered apple pieces also have skewer holes through them.  I have purchased nicer fruit trays from Walmart for half the price.  Very disappointed."
Excellent food will order from them again!!!!! Excellent
"the order was waiting to pick up just on time-
We will be back!"
This time the fruits were sweet! Their packaging is awesome and presentable
Adorable and delicious snack for clients. Will definitely use again.
"The food was great, and ready to go on time."
These are beautiful and everyone loves them. Wish they had more fun themed things
Edible Arrangements did such a fantastic job with my order. My order was ready on time and the presentation of the fruit was nice and neat. I highly recommend! It was a fan favorite and everyone loved it. They have large variety of options and the price ranges are reasonable as well.
office loved it. was something different nice set up and very professional
"The strawberry and apple dipped in chocolate was a huge hit. However, expensive for what you get."
Such a nice healthy option! We will use again soon.
Excellent.  Fresh.  On time for pick up.
It was well received by the clinic. No issues.
This was a big hit. Great variety of healthy and sweet.  Love the snack boxes.
This was a great mid day snack for the team during two all day meetings.
My office really liked the chocolate covered apples. I would recommend people to try those for their offices.
This was far the best morning delight we had in a long time.
"Ordered for delivery at 9:15,  and it didn’t come until 10:30! 3 stars though because the fruit was delicious. The chocolate covered strawberry cups look from the pictures as though they would be full but only had 3 strawberries per cup. They tasted yummy as well though!"
This location is great. They always go above and beyond to help
"Pretty fruit platter, something different from the usual platters that other caterers have."
Snack cups were a hit and easy to take on the go.
Great Service....On time service.  Thank you We will be ordering again!
Snack cups were perfect for a treat to grab and enjoy at work stations.
The fruit was good quality and the chocolate covered treats were a nice treat.
Very nice presentation.  Will order from them again.
"On time delivery, and fruit was delicious!  We will be ordering again."
We ordered these for a birthday for a member of our group that does not eat processed sugars and it was a hit! They appreciated that we ordered something outside of cake!
Better than my other order. Too expensive to make this many mistakes

On time and Very delicious! Everyone LOVED  it!
"Office loved food/snacks brought by Edible Arrangements- ""best snacks"".  However, I was informed delivery would occur between 2:15-2:30 pm.  This delivery came in around 2:00 pm instead; therefore, by the time, when my colleague and I got to the office around 2:15 pm or so, food/snacks had been consumed prior our arrival."
Quality was excellent and delivery was ON TIME !!
"Festive looking and fresh! Thank you, we will be ordering again soon"
